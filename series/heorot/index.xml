Written by powerhouse duo Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle (with a bit of help from Steven Barnes), it tells the tale of a group of humans who endure a ten-year frozen trip out to a new planet to start a human colony.&lt;/p>

The authors explore the complex relationships between the colonists, the dangerous predators (E.g. the grendels), and the scientific exploration of a new world. However, the novel falls short compared to its predecessor, The Legacy of Heorot.
The novel starts off slow but also shows a lot of promise.</description></item></channel></rss>
