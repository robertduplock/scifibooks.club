So the king agreed to let the man experience what it was like to have power. When the man took a seat at the throne, the king arranged to have a sword dangling above the man&amp;rsquo;s head, held in place by a single thread.

William Leisner’s &lt;em>Losing The Peace&lt;/em> is that kind of follow-up, giving the readers a moment to breathe after the epic events of &lt;em>Star Trek: Destiny&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

Poor President Bacco has developed a 24 hour migraine as she tries to patch the Federation back together. Who does she call? Why, none other than Earth’s resident problem solver and people persuader, Sonek Pran. The only battles in this book will be diplomatic ones. &lt;em>Star Trek: A Singular Destiny&lt;/em> by Keith R.A. DeCandido offers a thoughtful epilogue to &lt;em>Destiny&lt;/em> and also sets up some future storylines.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Trek: Titan: Over A Torrent Sea book review</title><link>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-titan-over-a-torrent-sea-book-review/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 02:01:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-titan-over-a-torrent-sea-book-review/</guid><description>Christopher L Bennet and I got beef. Of course, he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know me from a bar of soap. But reading through the post-Nemesis Star Trek litverse, I&amp;rsquo;ve now read 14 books in the series. And I hate to say it, but Bennet is my least favourite Trek writer.
Over A Torrent Sea, published in 2009 and the fifth Titan spinoff, is the perfect example of why Bennet and I don&amp;rsquo;t gel.</description></item><item><title>Star Trek: Voyager: Full Circle book review</title><link>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-voyager-full-circle-book-review/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 23:15:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-voyager-full-circle-book-review/</guid><description>When Kirsten Beyer picked up the heavy gauntlet of the Voyager relaunch titles, she sure faced a challenge. Apart from tying up the loose ends from the preceding novels, she also had to: 1) Deal with &amp;ldquo;the Janeway thing&amp;rdquo; from Before Dishonor 2) Launch the Full Circle Fleet storyline 3) Work it all in with the aftermath of Star Trek: Destiny
Once more unto the Delta Quadrant, dear friends&amp;hellip;

Namely, putting the Voyager crew back into their original seats&amp;hellip; more or less. With &lt;em>Full Circle&lt;/em>, author Kirsten Beyer sent the U.S.S. Starship &lt;em>Voyager&lt;/em> hurtling back to the Delta Quadrant, thanks to some mean and lean slipstream technology. But the crew were still fractured, physically and emotionally — what will it take to bring Starfleet&amp;rsquo;s finest back to the adventure?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Trek: Titan: Synthesis book review</title><link>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-titan-synthesis-book-review/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 03:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-titan-synthesis-book-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>William T. Riker and the diverse crew of the &lt;em>U.S.S. Titan&lt;/em> are back, this time in the hands of British author James Swallow. Following on from the lackluster &lt;em>Over A Torrent Sea&lt;/em> (by Christopher L Bennet), I was hoping that Mr. Swallow could inject some fun and action into this spinoff book series. Did he succeed?&lt;/p>

Martin returns to &lt;em>Star Trek: Titan&lt;/em> with &lt;em>Seize The Fire&lt;/em>. The Gorn have joined the Typhon Pact, but they have a problem. Their warrior caste hatchery world has gone kablooey, and it&amp;rsquo;s nigh-impossible to find another suitable location. Lucky for them, they have a big ol&amp;rsquo; terraforming device lying about. But Riker isn&amp;rsquo;t so keen on the idea of them using it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
