&lt;p>Those two words compelled me to pick up a secondhand copy of &lt;em>Night Train to Rigel&lt;/em> by Timothy Zahn. At the time I&amp;rsquo;d just moved to Sydney with my wife — we were house hunting, I was searching for a co-working space and adjusting to a new life in a new city. I suppose, to help me deal with all the stress, I was looking for a fun read&amp;hellip; 300 pages of entertaining escapism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter the first entry in Mr Zahn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Quadrail&lt;/em> series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Spoilers ahead&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Foundation book review</title><link>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/foundation-book-review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 04:58:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/foundation-book-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>Books don’t get much bigger than Asimov’s &lt;em>Foundation&lt;/em>. Awarded “Best All-Time Series” in 1966, &lt;em>Foundation&lt;/em> was a trailblazer — some say it even invented the space opera genre. Needless to say, it’s difficult not to have high expectations.&lt;/p>

It fused the space opera of Star Trek, the world-building of Dune, and the militaristic elements of Starship Troopers. It&amp;rsquo;s 537 pages of space-faring goodness. And if you think Europe has a lot of museums, just wait until you get to Mote Prime.
Unlike Star Trek, Dune and Starship Troopers, The Mote In God&amp;rsquo;s Eye shows its age. Race still divides people.</description></item><item><title>Star Trek: Voyager: Homecoming and The Farther Shore book review</title><link>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-voyager-homecoming-and-the-farther-shore-book-review/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 02:23:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-voyager-homecoming-and-the-farther-shore-book-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>After seven long years stranded in the Delta Quadrant, Janeway brought her crew back to the little blue planet she, and so many of her crew, called home.

First things first, this is one helluva Star Trek book. Kirsten Beyer takes the extra time and puts in a little extra thought — perhaps even love — into each Voyager book she writes.</description></item><item><title>Star Trek: Voyager: Protectors by Kirsten Beyer book review</title><link>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-voyager-protectors-by-kirsten-beyer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 07:13:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-voyager-protectors-by-kirsten-beyer/</guid><description>&lt;p>Kirsten Beyer is back with yet another &lt;em>Star Trek: Voyager&lt;/em> novel. &lt;em>Protectors&lt;/em> finds Admiral Janeway sent back to Earth for psych evaluations, while Chakotay and crew head out to re-investigate the spatial anomaly from the second season episode &lt;em>Twisted&lt;/em>, in which Voyager encountered an anomaly which twists and distorts the ship&amp;rsquo;s internal layout.&lt;/p>

Niven &amp;amp; Pournelle write big books; the kind of books that would make an effective doorstop for even the heaviest of doors in the windiest of cities. Footfall, featuring dozens of characters and multiple, interweaving storylines, feels a lot like an epic movie. It&amp;rsquo;s hard not to compare it to the Roland Emerich school of storytelling; Indendepence Day in particular feels heavily influenced by Footfall.</description></item><item><title>Ghost Riders In The Sky by Timothy Zahn review</title><link>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/ghost-riders-in-the-sky-timothy-zahn-novella-book-review-c/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 11:05:21 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/ghost-riders-in-the-sky-timothy-zahn-novella-book-review-c/</guid><description>&lt;p>In 2020, veteran sci-fi author Timothy Zahn dipped his toes into self-publishing for the first time, releasing the original novella &lt;em>Ghost Riders In The Sky&lt;/em>.
