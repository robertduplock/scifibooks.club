<p><strong>Historian’s Note</strong></p>
<p>The following takes place shortly after the events depicted in <em>Star Trek: Destiny</em>, in which the Federation is invaded by the Borg. Although the Federation prevailed, liberating billions of Borg drones in the process, they suffered huge casualties and are now faced with the difficulties of rebuilding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CHAPTER #1</strong></p>
<p>Standing on holodeck 4, you’d never know that the warm sunshine was nothing but a trick of the light. Captain Ezri Dax wriggled her toes in the short-cut grass below. Manicured gardens, rich with red and white foliage, surrounded the neatly mowed lawn in which she and six others now waited. At the front of the pack stood Sam Bowers, her XO and friend. He grinned with expectation.</p>
<p>“Welcome to the <em>Aventine</em>’s first-ever handstand class.” A soft murmur rose from the six people gathered before her. She continued, “Handstands have many benefits. They’re great for improving balance and building upper body strength. They keep you agile and get your blood pumping. But most importantly of all, they’re just plain fun to do.”</p>
<p>Bowers chuckled and said, “What made you want to share your secret superpower with us mere mortals?”</p>
<p>“We’ve had a tough run of it lately,” Dax said. “I need this crew to be at its best. That means keeping fit, staying healthy, and occasionally having a little fun.” The diminutive Trill woman stepped into the small crowd before her, splitting them sideways. “Everyone take a big step back and watch me.”</p>
<p>Dax leaned in and tipped herself over, performing a textbook handstand. She could smell the grass, her nose just inches away from the plush green ground, as she performed the handstand.</p>
<p>Righting herself, she straightened her Starfleet uniform and dusted her hands. “Easy as that.”</p>
<p>The crowd chuckled. Sam said, “Easy for you does not mean easy for us.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’ll break it down for you all.”</p>
<p>Dax demonstrated her technique one step at a time. All eyes were locked on her as she ran them through how to stand initially, the movement of tipping over onto stretched-out arms and how to balance. “It’s a smooth motion, not a lunge,” she said. “Keep your arms straight as you approach the ground. Let the momentum carry you, and then straighten your legs and aim them towards the big blue up there.”</p>
<p>Gymnastics was a part of Ezri Dax. As a joined Trill, she had all the memories and life experiences of all her former hosts. In previous incarnations, Ezri Dax had lived as a scientist, a diplomat, a musical composer and a politician. But right now, it was Emony who quelled from deep within. Emony was a gymnast, so performing a handstand was no big deal.</p>
<p>Presently, Dax walked around the circle and helped everyone, one by one. Lieutenant Naomi Darrow nearly headbutted the ground on her first attempt, but Dax helped her work through the movements. The portly Bolian Lieutenant Tharp seemed unable to commit to the full range of motion and required some encouragement to overcome his hesitation. The young Erin Constantino was not short on enthusiasm, deciding that constant repetition was an excellent way to learn something rather than focusing on form. Dax gently encouraged Constantino to slow down and concentrate on what her body was doing. The ensign nodded and grinned, evidently enjoying herself.</p>
<p>So far, the only person who’d managed to make their handstand stick was Commander Sam Bowers. She’d known him since her days on Deep Space Nine, and her heart was warmed by the fact he’d made the effort to come along, even though it probably wasn’t typically his idea of a good time. Plus, he was already pretty good at handstands.</p>
<p>As she approached Bowers, he performed a near-perfect handstand, walking around on his hands while his feet reached for the sky. He said, “If my legs give out, I can always get about like this.”</p>
<p>“Impressive,” Dax said with a smile, feeling a bead of sweat drip from her brow. “If you ever retire from Starfleet, gymnastics could be your next gig.”</p>
<p>Bowers tumbled over and landed on his rump. A cheeky grin covered his handsome, ebony face. He said, “I was thinking something more like a circus performer. I’m sure there is a circus troop making their way around the deep space stations, delighting the locals.”</p>
<p>“You would make an excellent clown.”</p>
<p>A gentle breeze tickled the side of Dax’s face as she moved away from Sam, ensuring others got their share of her attention. She didn’t want to look like she favoured the more senior crew.</p>
<p>Slowly, one by one, everyone except Tharp could perform something resembling a handstand. Dax stood in front of him and said, “Step forward and lean into it. I’ll catch your legs.”</p>
<p>“Really?” he asked, a little breathless.</p>
<p>“Just try not to kick your commanding officer in the face.”</p>
<p>Everyone turned to look at the pair. Dax cringed. She hadn’t meant to draw attention to the one person who was struggling. A warm sensation worked its way up into her cheeks. She swallowed and said, “There is no harm in trying.”</p>
<p>The lieutenant rubbed the nape of his neck. “My mind is willing, but I can’t guarantee my body will follow.” He stepped forward, leaned into it, stretched out his arms and kicked with his legs. Two flailing ankles shot towards her.</p>
<p>Dax felt her hands naturally move to intercept Tharp’s ankles — grabbing just above his boots. She held him in the air, and a moment later, everyone was clapping. The portly Bolian was upside down and doing a handstand… with a bit of help. While she held him by the ankles, her combadge chirruped. Instinctively, she let go, tapped her badge and said, “Dax here.”</p>
<p>Tharp tumbled over. <em>Wump!</em></p>
<p>“<em>Captain, you have an incoming transmission from Starfleet HQ.</em>” The voice belonged to ops manager Gaff chim Nak, who was currently on the bridge.</p>
<p>Dax crouched down to check Tharp was okay. The Bolian smiled, and she mouthed to word <em>sorry.</em> Aloud, she said, “Pipe it through to me here, Lieutenant.”</p>
<p>Gaff chim Nak’s husky voice responded, “<em>I believe Starfleet admirals prefer to keep their conversations private, rather than piped through the speakers of a holodeck for everyone to hear.</em>”</p>
<p>Dax felt her heart skip a beat. “Right. Send it through to my ready room. And maybe beam me straight there. And replicate a cool towel.”</p>
<p>“<em>Anything else?</em>”</p>
<p>“Would you consider taking over my handstand class?”</p>
<hr>
<p>A few moments later, Dax found herself surrounded by shimmering particles of light, and then she was in her ready room. A white towel waited for her on her desk. It was pleasantly cool to the touch when she gave herself a quick wipe down before tapping her console and bringing the Admiral online.</p>
<p>The face that appeared on the screen was instantly recognisable — Admiral Akaar. Famous for his tall body and a short fuse, Akaar was not known to mince words. He gave her a cold smile and said, “Am I interrupting something?”</p>
<p>Dax composed herself. “Sorry to keep you waiting, Admiral. I was putting the old Earth adage ‘healthy body, healthy mind’ into practice.”</p>
<p>The imposing Capellan admiral raised an eyebrow. “I’m afraid you’ll need to put your fitness plans on hold for the moment. We have an urgent mission for you.”</p>
<p>Nodding, Dax said, “No problem, Admiral. What are the details?”</p>
<p>“<em>During the Borg invasion, a lot of our ships fell off the map. People scattered. We’ve been doing our best to find survivors — any survivors. Starfleet just intercepted a weak subspace distress call from the</em> U.S.S. Sequeira_. Heard of it?_”</p>
<p>With a frown, Dax said, “It doesn’t ring any particular bell for me.”</p>
<p>“<em>I’d be surprised if it did. The</em> Sequeira <em>started off life as a small science vessel but was hastily refitted as a warship during the invasion. All the crew were soft-headed boffins, some of them civilians. Like so many others, they had to pick up a pitchfork and march to the frontlines during the war. Anyway, they’re badly damaged and trapped in a subspace distortion anomaly — probably the result of the collapsed transwarp conduits the Borg were so fond of.</em>”</p>
<p>“It sounds like their time is running out,” Dax said, “and you need slipstream velocities to reach them.”</p>
<p>“<em>Correct,</em>” Akaar said. “<em>We have ships closer than yours, but even so, you can get there the fastest.</em>”</p>
<p>Ezri’s ship, the <em>U.S.S. Aventine,</em> was one of only a handful of ships equipped with a quantum slipstream drive. This latest and greatest form of propulsion was still considered experimental, although no doubt soon enough, it would be standard issue across the fleet, replacing the older style warp engines.</p>
<p>“<em>I’m sending you the coordinates now. A word of warning, though. They’re trapped right on the edge of Federation space. Many salvagers and junk traders have been hovering around the edges of our territory, picking at the bones of war, hoping to find a little meat. Right now, the Federation does not need any new enemies. We need diplomats, not cowboys with their hands hovering by their phasers.</em>”</p>
<p>“Understood,” Dax said. Her mouth was slowly going dry. She eyed a glass of water on her table and took a small sip before continuing. “We’ll do our best to keep our torpedo bays locked, and our phasers powered down.”</p>
<p>“<em>One other thing,</em>” Akaar said. The big man cleared his throat. “<em>What the Federation also needs, right now, is a few good news stories. Spirits are low, and we’re worried that some may lose faith in our ways. Bring these men and women home, Captain Dax. That’s an order.</em>”</p>
<p>Dax licked her dry lips. “Sounds like we better get moving.”</p>
<p>Akaar gave a curt nod on the video screen. “Akaar out.”</p>
<p>Stealing a precious moment for herself, Dax leaned back into her chair and let out a long breath. She’d had a few admirals barking orders at her during the war, but when an armada of cubes filled to the brim with dead-eyed drones was heading your way — well, a grumpy admiral or two didn’t seem so bad. But now, in peacetime, a call from a Starfleet admiral was a little intimidating.</p>
<p>Her mind turned to the mission she’d been given. <em>I steered this ship through the invasion,</em> she thought. <em>I can handle a simple rescue mission.</em></p>
<p>Dax stood and marched through the sliding doors and onto the bridge. She heard the soft murmur of bridge chatter fall into silence. To her right, the turbolift doors opened. Commander Bowers stepped onto the bridge and gave her a subtle nod as he headed for his chair. She also noted Tharp had returned from the holodeck. He sat at the navigational console, a sleek shimmer of sweat still on his blue skin.</p>
<p>“We have a mission,” Dax said to the room. “There is a vessel stranded on the edge of Federation space, and our spiffy little ship can reach them first. Mister Tharp, please calculate a course for these coordinates.” She transferred the numbers Akaar had given her to Tharp’s navigational controls. “And don’t forget to carry the one — we’re in a bit of a hurry.”</p>
<p>“Aye,” he said.</p>
<p>Next, Dax tapped her commbadge. “Bridge to engineering.”</p>
<p>“<em>Leishman here,</em>” came the response. Mikaela Leishman, like Bowers, was another carry-over from Deep Space Nine.</p>
<p>“Chief, I need our best possible speed and then a little more if you can manage it. We’re on a rescue mission, and I don’t intend to be the bearer of bad news to any of their families any time soon.”</p>
<p>“<em>Understood</em>,” Leishman said. “<em>I’ll unleash my hoard of highly trained tribbles into the slipstream now. They’ll keep it running smoothly.</em>”</p>
<p>“Whatever it takes, Mikaela. Dax out.”</p>
<p>Taking a seat in the captain’s chair, she stared at the viewscreen — nothing much to see, other than a blanket of stars winking softly. Tharp turned to her and said, “Course calculated and plotted, and we have the thumbs up from engineering.”</p>
<p>The voice of Lonnoc Kedair came from behind. “These coordinates are the edge of Federation space. The very outer edge, at that.” The tough Tarkaran woman breathed through her nose. “There could be some trouble lurking in these waters.”</p>
<p>“Let’s keep our weapons holstered for the moment, Lieutenant. But we should be prepared for the fact that not everyone may welcome our visit.”</p>
<p>“Very well,” Lonnoc said.</p>
