Poor President Bacco has developed a 24 hour migraine as she tries to patch the Federation back together. Who does she call? Why, none other than Earth’s resident problem solver and people persuader, Sonek Pran.

Thus, Voyager&amp;rsquo;s relaunch is here, and veteran author Christie Golden is in charge.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Footfall book review</title><link>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/footfall-book-review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 02:42:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/footfall-book-review/</guid><description>Written in 1985, Footfall is an epic story of alien invasion. Niven &amp;amp; Pournelle write big books; the kind of books that would make an effective doorstop for even the heaviest of doors in the windiest of cities. Footfall, featuring dozens of characters and multiple, interweaving storylines, feels a lot like an epic movie. It&amp;rsquo;s hard not to compare it to the Roland Emerich school of storytelling; Indendepence Day in particular feels heavily influenced by Footfall.</description></item><item><title>Star Trek: Voyager complete series rewatch and review</title><link>https://scifibooks.club/blog/star-trek-voyager-complete-series-rewatch-and-review/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 04:13:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scifibooks.club/blog/star-trek-voyager-complete-series-rewatch-and-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, I did a re-watch of &lt;em>Star Trek: Voyager&lt;/em>.

However, he is perhaps best known for his Star Wars tie-in novel series &lt;em>Heir To The Empire&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
