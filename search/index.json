Coming in at a whopping 768 pages, it\u0026rsquo;s about 3x the length of a typical novel. Can it live up to the hype?\nSpoiler review\nIf you google something like \u0026ldquo;good space opera books\u0026rdquo;, you will find people all over the internet raving about Pandora\u0026rsquo;s Star. It\u0026rsquo;s a huge book with a large cast of characters that basically boils down to three main story threads.\nFirst and foremost, astronomer Dudley Bose discovers two star systems simultaneously enclosed by some kind of barrier — which becomes known as a Dyson Sphere. Thus, humans let their dang curiosity get the better of them, and send a starship out to investigate. Meanwhile, these wacko folks who call themselves the Guardians believe a malevolent alien called the Starflyer is secretly manipulating humanity into investigating the Dyson Sphere for its own nefarious purposes. Thirdly, eccentric bazillionaire Ozzie Isaacs decides he needs to find the Silfen — a mysterious, childlike alien race — and ask them what\u0026rsquo;s up with the Dyson Sphere. However, he gets trapped in a strange, icy world and has to escape.\n To be honest, I found myself skim-reading some of the long, dull scenes in the Ice Citadel.  When it comes to Pandora\u0026rsquo;s Star, I have one major quibble and a few minor quibbles. So let\u0026rsquo;s get the big one out of the way: the Ozzie storyline is a boring distraction from the main event. Ozzie\u0026rsquo;s actual motivation in seeking out the Silfen is vague, and as soon as he finds them, they are of no help — which is precisely what he expected. Then he gets trapped in the Ice Citadel and has to find a way out.\nTo be honest, I found myself skim-reading some of the long, dull scenes in the Ice Citadel. The whole thing felt unnecessary and barely connected to the main plot. And I expected it to pay off more by the end – to come back around and give me an aha moment. But it ended with a cliffhanger rather than a resolution.\nOkay, time for some minor quibbles. Some of the characters were a bit droll. Probably the most interesting ones were Paula Myo and Adam Elvin. Ozzie could have been a great character if he\u0026rsquo;d had a more exciting storyline. William Kime was okay, and Mellanie evolved into someone pretty interesting. But many of the characters — Nigel Sheldon, Alessandra Baron, Bradley Johansson, Hoshe Finn, Orion\u0026hellip; well, they didn\u0026rsquo;t exactly leap off the page.\nSpeaking of characters, I have another minor quibble: virtually all the characters were rich and powerful. A more balanced cast would have been nice. So often, the book seemed to be a set of endless dinner parties populated by the rich and famous.\nPaula Myo emerged as probably the best character in the book, but one thing that bugged me a bit was how often she bungled her investigation of Adam Elvin. She is meant to be a supercop. Yet often, Adam Elvin simply spots her in the crowd and aborts a mission. I get that he\u0026rsquo;s meant to be her one unsolved case and something that haunts her from her past. But often, I felt as though she\u0026rsquo;d be better off handing the case over to Hoshe.\nSome have criticised the book for its lack of strong female characters (other than Paula Myo). Most of the other major female characters are defined by a relationship to a male character. It\u0026rsquo;s a common problem with space opera, but considering the book was written in 2005, I might have hoped for something a little more.\nWhen it comes to worldbuilding, Peter F Hamilton really goes all-out. Every facet of life is upgraded: e-butlers, OC tattoos, dry coral houses, and trains that transit through wormholes. You name it, in the future, everything has a high-tech upgrade. Not to mention the human memory dumps and body rejuvenations. I think a big part of the book\u0026rsquo;s enduring popularity is that it\u0026rsquo;s a futuristic world that the reader can really sink into.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s no secret that sci-fi and fantasy readers love big books. Dune, The Wheel of Time, The Expanse — all these series comprise of door-stopper novels. However, coming in at a crazy 350 000 words, is Pandora\u0026rsquo;s Star too long? Honestly, I\u0026rsquo;d say yes. While it does offer remarkably good value (it\u0026rsquo;s basically the equivalent of an entire book trilogy, which sells on the Kobo store for about ten bucks), I sometimes wished the author had reined it in, just a little.\nAll that being said, the main story is a gripping one. Things get particularly good when they send a starship out to investigate the Dyson Sphere. I wish we\u0026rsquo;d got to spend a bit more time with Kime and his crew, but on the whole, it was an intriguing and imaginative story.\nPandora\u0026rsquo;s Star is an example of classy b-grade space opera. Unfortunately for me, it didn\u0026rsquo;t quite live up to the hype. But I still enjoyed it, and I plan to read the sequel, Judas Unchained. After a little break, perhaps.\n  Images care of the amazing artist Kenovy.

The Last Best Hope is a prequel to the TV series and tells the story of how the plan to evacuate Romulus went so wrong.\nSpoilers ahead!\nFor the record, I am a Picard fan. I decided to read The Last Best Hope as I rewatched season one, in preparation for the upcoming season two. I acknowledge the show had its faults (particularly in the last couple of episodes), and it is a much darker Trek than what we\u0026rsquo;ve had before. It\u0026rsquo;s not everyone\u0026rsquo;s cup of earl grey, and that\u0026rsquo;s okay.\nAnyway, back to the book. My wife said to me once, \u0026ldquo;Sometimes you pick up a book, read the first page, and you just know that you\u0026rsquo;re in good hands.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s how I felt picking up The Last Best Hope. The first thing I noticed is how lovingly the book is written. The prose is neat and clean, and the story is nicely paced — not too fast, not too slow.\nThe plot goes like this: the Romulans, long time enemies of the Federation, are facing certain destruction as their sun is set to go supernova. Jean-Luc Picard, now an Admiral, leads a massive rescue effort. However, not everyone thinks Starfleet should burn the candle at both ends saving their old enemy. Furthermore, they face resistance from the Romulans themselves, who have a longstanding culture of fear and paranoia.\nIf the book has a theme, I\u0026rsquo;d say the following quote (which is used in the book) sums it up nicely:\n It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness. That is life.\n— Jean-Luc Picard, Star Trek: The Next Generation\n The main story thread involves Picard and his new XO Raffi Musiker tirelessly trying to save as many Romulan lives as possible. The pair, and all those involved in the rescue effort, really do nothing especially wrong. Yes, they take some risks. But they never stuff it up. The mission fails due to a confluence of events largely out of their hands. And yet, the failure utterly wrecks their lives. I guess, reflecting on the above quote, they get a solid taste of life.\nUna McCormack does a stellar job introducing Raffi and building her relationship with Picard. The mission wreaks havoc on Raffi\u0026rsquo;s personal life, as she sacrifices her relationship with her husband and son to keep going, year after year, saving Romulan lives — even when they are less than grateful. Despite the unhappy ending, it was a joy to watch their camaraderie grow in the early stages of the book.\nThe Last Best Hope creates an essential bridge between the optimistic Trek of yore and this newer, darker take. We learn that most Federation citizens were in favour of helping the Romulans. But as the rescue effort dragged on and the costs piled up, support waned. Opportunistic politicians such as Olivia Quest found a way to capitalise on anti-Romulan sentiment. And then the synths went rogue on Mars, which was the final nail in the coffin for the rescue effort.\nBringing Jordie La Forge into the story was a stroke of genius. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know that his character would make an appearance, and the early scenes with him puzzling out the shipyard production issues were outstanding. It was a nice little bonus to have a character from The Next Generation TV series find his way into the book.\nMy favourite subplot was the one that focused on Earth scientist and astronomer Doctor Amal Safadi and her Romulan counterpart Doctor Nokim Vritet. Safadi discovers that the Romulan sun is going supernova faster than expected, and the effects will be bigger than expected. However, she can\u0026rsquo;t get this information corroborated by her Romulan counterpart, as the Romulan secret police (the Tal Shiar) keep getting in the way. The two characters never meet, and yet they feel connected. Vritet eventually goes full 1984 and buys into the Romulan propaganda, believing everything is fine. It\u0026rsquo;s a horrible, tragic and yet profound moment in the story.\nAnother plotline focuses on Agnes Juradi and Bruce Maddox. They create an army of non-sentient worker synths who populate the shipbuilding facility on Mars, churning out huge starships for the rescue effort. And then the other other plotline focuses on politician Oliva Quest, who leads a campaign to have the rescue efforts reigned in. Yeah, there are quite a few plotlines in this one.\nMany themes from today work their way effortlessly into the story. Real-life Brexit, for example, was nothing but a thinly veiled manifestation of anti-refugee sentiment in the UK. In this story, a Brexit-like campaign is carried out by Olivia Quest and her cronies. Other themes such as climate change, misinformation, the importance of independent media and independent scientific research litter the pages. In many ways, McCormack wrestles with these big ideas better than the TV show — they\u0026rsquo;re woven into the story by the very nature of the action and events, rather than feeling tacked on and preachy.\n In many ways, McCormack wrestles with these big ideas better than the TV show  Interestingly, the book isn\u0026rsquo;t afraid to drop an f-bomb or two. There is quite a bit of coarse language used. Those of us who remember the nice, family-friendly Trek of the 80s and 90s might find this a bit jarring. But then, like all things, Trek must move with the times.\nMy one criticism of the book is that the story seems to lose a little oomph in the second half. Many storylines peter out, shrinking into themselves rather than resolving satisfyingly. Jordie La Forge, for example, doesn\u0026rsquo;t do much once the shipbuilding plant is up and running. Picard and Raffi continue their mission with varying degrees of success until, finally, an unexpected event cuts their mission short.\nIt is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. Maybe. But perhaps one last little juicy plot point towards the end of the book would have really wrapped up things nicely. For example, what if Picard ordered Jordie La Forge to give him an in-person report, and so Jordie left Mars (to visit Picard) just before the synth rebellion took place? Thus, Starfleet grew suspicious that Picard had prior knowledge of the synth rebellion. That would give them an extra reason to cut the mission short. What if Quest found this out, and used it as political ammo?\nAll that being said, The Last Best Hope still does a fantastic job detailing the events leading up to the show. The book is lovingly crafted with thoughtful detail, has an excellent grasp of character, and has a tone that complements its small-screen counterpart nicely. It\u0026rsquo;s balanced and considered, and for me, I like the TV show more for having read it. I\u0026rsquo;d say that\u0026rsquo;s pretty high praise.\nIn a few months, Una McCormack\u0026rsquo;s follow-up novel Star Trek: Picard: Second Self will be hitting the shelves, and I, for one, cannot wait to read it.\n","summary":"When Una McCormack was selected to write the first tie-in novel for Star Trek: Picard, one could only imagine the pressure she must have felt.

At the time I\u0026rsquo;d just moved to Sydney with my wife — we were house hunting, I was searching for a co-working space and adjusting to a new life in a new city. I suppose, to help me deal with all the stress, I was looking for a fun read\u0026hellip; 300 pages of entertaining escapism.\nEnter the first entry in Mr Zahn\u0026rsquo;s Quadrail series.\nSpoilers ahead\nThe book starts with a classic Timothy Zahn hook. Frank Compton is a down-on-his-luck former Western Alliance Intelligence Agent, is visited by a mysterious stranger — who, of course, winds up dead by chapter 2. It turns out the Spiders, who run the Quadrail (an interstellar train system) need some help. Their trains are super safe, except someone has found out how to smuggle weapons on board, and that is most definitely not allowed if you read their Ts\u0026amp;Cs carefully. The Spiders run the trains, but no one knows who or what they are.\nOne could say Night Train to Rigel is a fast-paced action-adventure. Except when I say it\u0026rsquo;s fast-paced, I mean it is fast-paced. Author Timothy Zahn wastes no time in getting to the meat of the story. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect any lengthy scenes, filled with pathos and long goodbyes. Nope. Frank Compton is out there playing space cop and chasing down the bad guys by the time you can say \u0026ldquo;tickets please!\u0026rdquo;\nFrank Compton is teamed up with Bayta, a blank-faced and emotionally distant woman who can communicate with the otherwise mute Spiders. Where Compton is brazen, brash and bold — Bayta is quiet, thoughtful and impassive. She\u0026rsquo;s human, but you get the idea pretty early on that she\u0026rsquo;s not quite fully human if you catch my drift.\nThe book draws obvious inspiration from classic spy-thriller movies such as Hitchcock\u0026rsquo;s North by Northwest and Strangers on a Train. In fact, in my head, I even imagined Carey Grant and Eva Marie Saint as the Quadrail riding characters Compton and Bayta.\nThe story has plenty of twists and turns. Perhaps a few too many twists and turns, actually, as at times the story can get muddled and confusing. And the whole thing is a little bit silly. But then, it\u0026rsquo;s not a book you are supposed to take seriously. Rather, it\u0026rsquo;s a whole lot of schlocky, pulpy fun.\nA minor quibble I had was the distinct lack of female characters. To my count, the book totals one solitary female in the named cast. Bayta. By today\u0026rsquo;s standards, that\u0026rsquo;s not great. It didn\u0026rsquo;t stop me from enjoying the story, but it could put a lot of people off.\nProbably the best part of Night Train to Rigel is Mr Zahn\u0026rsquo;s wonderful world-building, which includes an incredible cast of kooky and peculiar aliens. I enjoyed the imagery of a train carriage filled with a bunch of Star Wars-esque aliens, chattering away in exotic languages and eating strange foods. Add to that the number of little details; self-wheeling luggage, ditrecs (what they call movies in the future), and shady secret agents, and it adds up to a slightly bumpy but absolutely enjoyable ride.\nThe bad guy is also pretty original. I won\u0026rsquo;t bother to explain it, other than to say it\u0026rsquo;s a hive-minded creature that lives in cold water. As you read the book, it becomes pretty obvious that Mr Zahn let his imagination run wild, and never let believability get in the way of telling a good story.\nThis book forms the first in the Quadrail series, of which there are five in total. Timothy Zahn planned to write 10-12 Quadrail books, but the publisher (TOR) canned the series at book 5. That said, he did have time to finish off the multi-book arc that runs through the series, so don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it ending on a cliffhanger.\n I enjoyed the imagery of a train carriage filled with a bunch of Star Wars-esque aliens, chattering away in exotic languages and eating strange foods.  When he\u0026rsquo;s not writing books about space trains, Mr Zahn is most famous for his Star Wars novels — in particular the Heir to the Empire series featuring his original bad-guy creation Grand Admiral Thrawn. I\u0026rsquo;ve never read a Star Wars tie-in novel, but if I intended to I would start there.\nOverall, Night Train to Rigel was exactly the book I needed to read during a stressful and disruptive time in my life. It\u0026rsquo;s fun. It\u0026rsquo;s a humorous and light-hearted read that doesn\u0026rsquo;t take itself too seriously. Pick it up if you\u0026rsquo;re in the right mood, and enjoy the ride.\n","summary":"Space trains.\nThose two words compelled me to pick up a secondhand copy of Night Train to Rigel by Timothy Zahn.

Awarded “Best All-Time Series” in 1966, Foundation was a trailblazer — some say it even invented the space opera genre. Needless to say, it’s difficult not to have high expectations.\nSpoilers ahead.\nFoundation, written in the 1940s but collected and published in 1951, is an enduring classic. The story has that big retro sci-fi feel, where anything is possible. Set it 50 000 years in the future? Sure. 25 million planets contained within a single empire? Hell yeah.\nSome parts of the book have aged like wine, others like milk. Let’s get the negatives out of the way. Firstly, I don’t think I counted a single female character. Not even one. Secondly, nuclear power is all the rage, with the split atom powering everything from electric razors to clock radios. Thirdly, there are minor details dragged in from yesteryear — like people chuffing on a cigar or reading a newspaper. Most of this is pretty forgivable, assuming the no-girls-allowed thing doesn’t bother you too much. The book is 70 years old, after all.\nFoundation’s story itself is a collection of loosely connected novellas set within the same fictional universe. Each one leaps ahead in time, casting a new set of characters and exploring the decline of the empire and the rise of the Foundation from a different angle.\nThe most unexpected part of the story, for me, was the focus on religion. The Foundation keeps those pesky outer planets in check by turning the Foundation’s advanced science into a spiritual belief system. Acolytes to the faith rote learn how to control the mighty machines, without understanding the mechanics behind them. But as time progresses, religion no longer keeps the populace sufficiently on their knees. Thus, trade becomes the emerging force by which the Foundation keeps itself in relative safety.\nIt seems that mathematician and crystal-ball enthusiast Hari Seldon can predict the future pretty well, and most of the time the characters keep out of history’s way until the next “Seldon Crisis” presents itself. On the face of it, a set of characters championing the idea of doing nothing — unless a hologram of the big man himself, Hari Seldon, rises from the grave and gives direction to the nearest, man, woman or child what to do and where to go — could be a rather boring story. It’s often the tension between when to act and when to kick back that drives the narrative forward.\nDialogue rules Foundation. A good portion of the book is spying on philosophical conversations, backroom deals, political machinations and social manoeuvring. There are no space battles, no military institutions, and no alien bad guys to blow up.\nAsimov’s prose is lean and clean in the extreme. Terse, even. His descriptions of the wondrous future are bare and often rely on the reader\u0026rsquo;s imagination to fill in the gaps. Although the book can feel a bit rushed at first, I believe it’s Asimov’s succinct prose that helps it be so readable today. The arcana of futuristic technology or science never threatens to bog the story down.\n Believers in free will need not apply for a position in Hari Seldon’s team.  Foundation poses a fascinating thought experiment: Could we eventually learn to predict the future scientifically? Analyse the data, run the numbers, and predict the likely outcomes? Hari Seldon believes that pschohistory — which is, I suppose, a pastiche of psychology and mathematics — can do just that. Believers in free will need not apply for a position in Hari Seldon’s team.\nGiven the book spans a couple of hundred years and lacks anything in the way of action or romance, anyone crazy enough to adapt it into a TV series would soon grow a lot of grey hairs and possibly take up day drinking. Not surprisingly, Apple TV’s “adaption” of the show is only loosely connected to the book’s plot. I don’t have a problem with gender flipping the main characters, or whatever other casting choices were made. But the story itself barely resembles what’s between the covers. For example, Salvor Hardin is now a trigger-happy town sheriff — whereas in the book he/she often quotes the phrase: violence is the last refuge of the incompetent. Okay, I realise some big character arc is probably being set up, in which Hardin learns that bigger guns don’t equal better results. But it’s difficult to watch the show and wonder why it had to stray so far from the source material.\nOkay, back to the book. For some reason I often find myself comparing Foundation to Frank Herbert’s Dune. I don’t know why, other than they’re both old-timey sci-fi books that I’ve read in recent years. For me, Dune has aged better, although it was written many years later. It will be interesting to read the next two Foundation books and compare them to the mixed bag that was Dune Messiah and Children of Dune.\nThere is a lot to like about Foundation. It weaves together themes of free will, scientific persecution, religious institutional power, and trade-vs-colonisation. If you can forgive the dated aspects — particularly the all-male cast — it holds up as a genuinely clever study of how, in the face of crumbling civilisation, we might dedicate our lives to the pursuit of something truly bigger.\n To succeed, planning alone is insufficient. One must improvise as well.\n Foundation, part 5 chapter 3 / Isaac Asimov  ","summary":"Books don’t get much bigger than Asimov’s Foundation.

And if you think Europe has a lot of museums, just wait until you get to Mote Prime.\nUnlike Star Trek, Dune and Starship Troopers, The Mote In God\u0026rsquo;s Eye shows its age. Race still divides people. Somehow the Scottish accent has survived for 1000 years, even when humanity has colonised every rocky planet within spitting distance of Earth. Unlike Star Trek, which was woke 50 years before the term even existed, The Mote In God\u0026rsquo;s Eye feels rooted in the 70s. Themes of race, overpopulation, xenophobia and the military-industrial complex weave their way into the story.\nIf you read a book written five decades ago, you have to give a few things a pass. However, these retro aspects didn\u0026rsquo;t worry me too much.\nThe Mote In God\u0026rsquo;s Eye features a large cast of characters. The main character, Rod Blaine, is a Captain Kirk-ish figure with a tendency to touch his nose when he\u0026rsquo;s feeling insecure. His counterpart is the menacing Russian stereotype Kutuzov, a man so devoted to keeping humanity safe he\u0026rsquo;d sleep just fine after an unprecedented act of genocide. And indeed, it almost comes to that.\nIt will thrill fans of diversity to find but a single female character, Sally. She acts as both Rod\u0026rsquo;s progressive conscience and his love interest. Ok, all the Moties except for a few is female\u0026hellip; but they don\u0026rsquo;t count. With female leads standard fare these days, it\u0026rsquo;s odd to imagine a future in which men alone rule the stars.\n The aliens themselves are the stars of the show.  The world-building is impressive in its scope and detail. The CoDominium, as it is known, is the rich and complex universe in which the story takes place. Some of Pournelle\u0026rsquo;s other works are also set in this universe. However, this book remains independent, and you don\u0026rsquo;t need to read the others to get the overall story.\nThe aliens themselves are the stars of the show. They are lopsided and grotesque, with a permanent smile planted on their face, like a politician at a dinner party. Once the humans make first contact, they visit Mote Prime and see the sights. The first stop on the Motie\u0026rsquo;s Hop-on Hop-off bus is one of many museums. Rod and co learn that the Moties breed like rabbits. Overpopulation, followed by cataclysmic wars, is par-for-the-course on their world. So the population keeps a few time capsules for the next time their entire civilisation crumbles, and the neo-caveman Moties start all over again.\nMy main gripe with the storyline is that I never saw the Moties as a threat. Everyone is so paranoid all the time, except for Sally and a few scientists. The basic premise is that they will expand into humanity\u0026rsquo;s territory and get into mischief because of their crazy engineering skills and a bed-breaking breeding rate. Imagine that? Humanity, so troubled by reproduction rates, they\u0026rsquo;re prepared to launch a giant old bomb with Die Motie\u0026rsquo;s Die scrawled on the side. Somehow, it just never quite rang true for me.\nThe book offers an entertaining, very readable space opera adventure. It\u0026rsquo;s a first contact story, jumbled amongst a patchwork of different sci-fi tropes. Niven and Pournelle always write in a lean-and-clean style, which is easy to read and focuses on the story and characters.\nA long list of characters fills the chapters. Like Niven and Pournelle\u0026rsquo;s Footfall, certain characters don\u0026rsquo;t serve any obvious function. For example, Nabil (Horace Bury\u0026rsquo;s servant/assassin) is touted to be an underhanded and deadly threat. And yet, that particular Chekhov\u0026rsquo;s gun never fires. Nabil does pretty much nothing. Also, as with Footfall, the aliens come across as quite samey. The idea of the Fyunch(click) Moties was cool. Every main character had their Motie. But Niven and Pournelle portray them as a homogenous group, thinking and acting like one.\nNiven and Pournelle have become some of my favourite authors. Having read two of their works, I am looking forward to reading Lucifer\u0026rsquo;s Hammer next. Each of their books is the size of a typical YA trilogy, so you get good value when you pick up one of their tomes.\nThe Mote In God\u0026rsquo;s Eye is an epic adventure full of original ideas and fun characters. Yes, in some ways, it hasn\u0026rsquo;t aged that well. And yes, it gets a bit bogged down in the second act. Perhaps it could have been 50 pages shorter.

And cut. Draw the curtains and clean the stage. Voyager is home. Of course, all good Trek geeks turn to the books to continue the events once the show ends. Thus, Voyager\u0026rsquo;s relaunch is here, and veteran author Christie Golden is in charge.\nStar Trek: The Next Generation’s first relaunch title, Death In Winter, got the post-TV/movie era off to a shaky start for Picard and his crew. I hoped that the two-parter Homecoming and The Farther Shore would see Voyager’s relaunch land on steadier ground.\nAfter all, the series left behind a showbag jam-packed with loose ends that the books could build on. For example, after four seasons with nary a sultry look in Chakotay’s direction, Seven suddenly finds herself in love with Chakotay in the season finale. Homecoming had an obvious manifesto to quickly reverse that decision. There were plenty more loose ends: How will the people of Earth treat the Doctor? Will Tom Paris find peace with his father? Will the Marquee crew members face trial? I could go on\u0026hellip;\n The challenge with Star Trek books is that something needs to happen other than a bunch of the crew having lunch dates with their long-lost loved ones  The most common criticism of Homecoming is that it views these loose ends as a bothersome obstacle, rather than an opportunity to organically grow some interesting storylines. Golden gets out her dustpan and brush and sweeps them up. No muss, no fuss.\nI really feel for Golden. The challenge with Star Trek books is that something needs to happen other than a bunch of the crew having lunch dates with their long-lost loved ones. Without some action, how do you explore the loose ends in a way that is dramatically satisfying? In saying that, I thought the story of a Borg virus was actually pretty clever. Infect, rather than assimilate.\nReading the first half of Homecoming, I found that I quite enjoyed seeing each character get their brief moment in the sun. Harry reuniting with his parents (and Libby), for example, was a nice moment. But then, two-thirds in, the book has wrapped all that up and suddenly the Borg virus is everywhere.\nOf the three parts of the story that continue through to The Farther Shore, the one I particularly disliked was the holostrike. I can see how it could have sounded cool in theory. But in practice? If all \u0026ldquo;sentient holograms\u0026rdquo; go on strike, that essentially means the Federation has enslaved millions, perhaps billions, of sentient beings. And if they aren\u0026rsquo;t sentient, then it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to have any sympathy for them. And holographic restaurant furniture? Does that mean the holographic seat that cushioned Janeway\u0026rsquo;s butt in the restaurant scene was secretly dreaming of another life as a kitchen countertop?\nThe other-other plot, involving B\u0026rsquo;Elanna, was reasonably well written but ultimately felt like a pointless diversion. It had no impact on the main story and obviously existed purely to set up future storylines.\nGolden has an interesting writing style that, for lack of a better word, one might describe as old-fashioned. It\u0026rsquo;s a pleasant writing style. It is neither verbose nor brief, neither lyrical nor lean-and-clean. However, by the second book, there was a lot of telling/explaining. Each chapter was like; Here\u0026rsquo;s Libby. Libby is thinking about a bunch of stuff. Libby calls someone. Oh no, Libby feels worried.\n Homecoming was not the disaster it was rumoured to be  Something that annoys me as a reader is when an author keeps a piece of information away from me to build suspense. Golden does this when B\u0026rsquo;Elanna reads the letter from her mother, but the reader does not get the see the contents of that letter. Instead, B\u0026rsquo;Elanna folds it up, puts it in her pocket, and is like; \u0026ldquo;See ya Tom and my newborn child, I\u0026rsquo;m off to probably die in some Klingon ritual even though I totally eschew Klingon culture. Bye.\u0026rdquo; As a reader, I am supposed to gasp and feverishly turn the pages until I discover the contents of the letter. In reality, I roll my eyes and put the book back on the nightstand.\nDespite my criticisms, I found Homecoming was not the disaster it was rumoured to be. It was a pleasant way to reunite with the Voyager crew, and even though everything wrapped up a bit too neatly, I mostly enjoyed it. Unfortunately, the convoluted holostrike story, too much focus on non-Voyager characters, a pointless-feeling side quest for B\u0026rsquo;Elanna, and some lazy writing meant that The Farther Shore was a lot less enjoyable. I mainly wanted to read these two books to set myself up to read the later books, starting with Voyager: Full Circle.\nTrekBBS readers rated Homecoming as \u0026ldquo;Below Average\u0026rdquo; and The Farther Shore as \u0026ldquo;Average\u0026rdquo;.\n","summary":"After seven long years stranded in the Delta Quadrant, Janeway brought her crew back to the little blue planet she, and so many of her crew, called home.

Can author Michael Jan Friedman maneuver the Star Trek TNG books into this new era?\nSpoilers ahead!\nHistory Before writing Death In Winter, author Michael Jan Friedman had just wrapped up his 6th Stargazer book, a spinoff book series focusing on a young Jean Luc Picard aboard his previous ship, the Stargazer. Death In Winter was originally published in 2005 (hardback) and then paperback in 2007. This was his 37th and final Star Trek book.\nGiven his extensive work with a young Picard (as well quite a few Picard focused TNG books), Friedman must have seemed like a safe pair of hands to kick off the \u0026ldquo;relaunch\u0026rdquo; book phase. An interview with Friedman revealed that managing editor Margaret Clark came to him and stated that the story was to wrap up the Picard and Beverly relationship once and for all. It seems they wanted to get that ambiguoty out of the way, so other events could then proceed.\nInitially Friedman hadn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily thought to directly involve the Romulans or set the book in amongst the political and social fallout from Nemesis. However the story would eventually pivot towards a Romulan heavy cast, with the Picard/Crusher plot humming away in the background.\nIn regards to the shared continutiy amongst the relaunch novels, supposedly, this new fangled \u0026ldquo;relaunch\u0026rdquo; timeline would work as a single continuity because Simon \u0026amp; Schuster organized a writers room with a managing editor who acted like a showrunner. TNG, DS9, VOY, the spinoff Titan and a few others would now share a common literary timeline and universe.\nAt this point the Star Trek book writers were given a lot more freedom then they had in the past.\nStory The book opens with an intriguing scene featuring a Romulan spy, posing as a waiter, attempting to steal a small sample of Picard\u0026rsquo;s DNA. Since the good old method of plucking a hair from a hairbrush really wasn\u0026rsquo;t an option when acquiring a sample of Jean-Luc Picard\u0026rsquo;s DNA, the waiter pinches his champagne flute instead. We can assume from there he and his comrades go about the thankless task of retro-fitting Tom Hardy into Picard\u0026rsquo;s persona.\nStill in historical mode, Friedman shows us a young Beverly Howard, living on Arvada III. There she witnesses her grandma whipping up miracle cures with the local produce, and before she knows it she\u0026rsquo;s on her way to med school. Maybe she joined Starfleet to pay off her student debt?\nCutting back to the present day, Riker is off to command the Titan while Picard is left to deal with the Romulan political quagmire. It\u0026rsquo;s not long until a couple of former Stargazer crewman show up and start helping out and causing trouble in equal measure.\nMeanwhile, Crusher has left the Enterprise to engage in a covert mission to cure the deadly Bloodfire, while the Romulan\u0026rsquo;s want to snatch her away and keep the cure all for themselves. Selfish bastards.\nOpinion A lot of the readers enjoyment of this book will depend upon their interest in the ins and outs of Romulan politics. There is back-stabbing, double-crossing and hidden agendas everywhere. But somehow it never seemed to quite gel with the Picard/Crusher storyline. It simply felt half-baked and rushed. Personally I\u0026rsquo;m just not a huge fan of the Romulans or Sela, and so although the political manouvering was interesting in parts, it never quite had me turning the page as rapidly as I\u0026rsquo;d hope.\nBut there is a redeeming feature that makes this worth the read. Picard finally realises that he needs to tell Crusher how he feels. And by the end of the book, they are\u0026hellip; together? Togetherish? She chooses to come back aboard the Enterprise and professionally point her medical tricorder at whoever may need her help.\nStar Trek The Next Generation is tough to write, and now that The Enterprise is without Riker, Troi and Data, I think that Friedman tried to plug those gaps with a couple of his Stargazer characters. It misses the fun interplay between Geordi and Data, or Riker and Picard. Although I\u0026rsquo;d like to read at least one of the Stargazer books one day, I\u0026rsquo;m not familiar with them. So when Pug and Carter showed up, I just felt vaguely annoyed I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to spend some time with another TNG character. What about Guinan? Or Barclay?\n Star Trek The Next Generation is tough to write, and now that The Enterprise is without Riker, Troi and Data, I think that Friedman tried to plug those gaps with a couple of his Stargazer characters.  And what is with the pointless Geordi/Worf subplot? It felt like Friedman was a bit short on his word count, so he tacked on a side story that went nowhere.\nOh yeah. Tasha Yar, err I mean Sala shows up because Romulans. Oh and Admiral Janeway shows up (see pointless subplot above).\nFor me, I found the main tension of the book came from the Picard/Crusher will-they-won\u0026rsquo;t-they moments. I wished the book focused less on the Romulans and expanded the Picard/Crusher storyline a bit. I would have written the ending to be the new Enterprise team banding together to save the day. A lot happens in the book and there are a lot of characters. A simpler, more cohesive story could have beem much more effective.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t envy the writer who has to \u0026ldquo;relaunch\u0026rdquo; the post Nemesis litverse. There were a lot of loose ends to tie up. A lot of characters to shuffle around. Friedman’s writing style is fast-paced, which is fine as long as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel rushed. Unfortunately, this book did feel rushed.\nFriedman is known as a writer who likes to explore the untold past of Star Trek characters. The book begins with some interesting history and I found myself really enjoying those aspects. Perhaps he would have been best to focus a little more on some backstory elements, and have those elements play into the current events.\nThere is also something to be said for easter eggs vs backstory. When the two Stargazer crew show up, I suppose it was meant to be a nice easter egg for the Stargazer fans. But if you haven\u0026rsquo;t read those books then it becomes a bit of a confusing and frustrating experience. It may be the same with the many Romulan characters. If you know the backstory of them from the show or movies the story might feel a lot richer. Although I\u0026rsquo;ve watched every episode of TNG (and the movies) I simply don\u0026rsquo;t remember that many specifics of each character. It can be nice for those with that extra knowledge of the books or the show to get a little something extra from the story, as long as it still reads well if you don\u0026rsquo;t have that knowledge. For me, I felt like I needed a history lesson before I could appreciate all the details.\nReception The book has generally received negative reviews online. It currently has a meagre 3.64 score on Goodreads. Even the most positive reviews online tend to be along the lines of \u0026ldquo;Hey it\u0026rsquo;s not that bad!\u0026rdquo; The Trek Collective stated that they \u0026ldquo;found the Stargazer characters an annoying distraction.\u0026rdquo; While Trek Lit describe the Geordi/Worf subplot as a \u0026ldquo;strange misstep\u0026rdquo;. Trek Movie declared \u0026ldquo;Friedman’s prose seems rushed and lacks a depth and luster that his former works have possessed.\u0026rdquo;\nOn a more positive note, Trekcore declared that \u0026ldquo;Overall, Death in Winter was the story that many fans had been waiting for; the coupling of Picard and Crusher.\u0026rdquo;\nFriedman actually never wrote another Star Trek book after this one. It seems likely that the negative response to this book might have meant he decided to give the Trek books a rest. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure this book is simply not Friedman\u0026rsquo;s best work.\nSales for the book were below average.\nThe final verdict An average first entry into the post Nemesis relaunch. Worth reading mainly for the Picard/Crusher plot. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, there are better books to come.\nLinks https://www.trektoday.com/interviews/friedman_death_in_winter.shtml\nhttps://blog.trekcore.com/2020/01/prelude-to-star-trek-picard-retro-review-death-in-winter\nhttps://trekmovie.com/2007/08/04/review-death-in-winter/\nhttp://www.treklit.com/2019/05/DeathinWinter.html\n","summary":"DNA thieves, Beverly Crusher\u0026rsquo;s maiden name and a few guest appearances from the USS Stargazer.

Can this book of new diverse characters find its feet and deliver a compelling read?\nSpoilers ahead!\nHistory Taking Wing was published in 2005. Authors Martin and Mangels started off their careers writing for fan magazines and comic books. The pair had been writing Star Trek in various forms together for a decade before being entrusted with kicking off this new franchise.\nThe writers were in part inspired by the early episodes of Voyager, in which a politically diverse crew did not always get along. They (like me) felt disappointed that the tension between Voyager crew members faded in just a few episodes, so they decided that the same tension could be carried into this series in a more ongoing fashion. As a further point of different to other Star Trek entries, Titan would feature an incredibly diverse cast of characters, including many aliens (some of them non-humanoid).\nCuriously, the first three Titan books were written (or at least outlined) at the same time. The first two were written by Martin and Mangels, while the third book was written by Christopher L Bennet. The sense I got from an interview with Martin and Mangels is that they created the entire cast of Titan, with some input from managing editor Margaret Clark and fellow author Bennet.\nWith the show and movie franchise essentially dead in the water, the authors were given a lot of freedom with the cast and general direction of the Titan series. Martin and Mangels would only write three Titan books in total.\nStory Starfleet is finally ready to start exploring outer space again, now that the Dominion war is over, the Borg invasion was sent packing, and the Cardassians and the Klingons are now enjoying the soft beds and warm hearts of The Federation. And who better to launch the new Luna class ship Titan into the far reaches of space than Riker and Troi, the power couple of Starfleet. Except no, sorry guys you have to head back to Romulus to help facilitate power sharing talks amongst the various Romulan parties. This includes the space-Nazis Tal Shiar, Praetor Tal\u0026rsquo;Aura, Spock\u0026rsquo;s most logical reunification movement, the Remans, the military… Oh man, just so many people.\nHelping out Spock with his efforts to bring the Romulan’s back into the bosom of the Vulcan Council is Star Trek Voyager’s favourite commander, Tuvok. However since he’s stuck in a Romulan jail, he’s not adding a whole lot of value to the cause.\nTo complicate things further, the Klingons show up and side with the Romulans. Riker has to walk a political tightrope while also making sure he and his crew don’t accidentally fall into the void of The Great Bloom.\nAll this while breaking in a new crew, including an exec by the name of Christine Vale who doesn’t like the idea of serving alongside the captain’s missus, and dino doctor Shenti Yisec Eres Ree. And… whoops Titan falls into The Great Bloom. Now that’s inconvenient.\nOpinion Like its sister novel Death In Winter, Taking Wing mixes the post Nemesis Romulan political fallout with establishing a new status quo. The writers introduce us to a dizzying array of new characters. Some are minor characters from the TV show, such as gravity-hater Melora Pazlar who originally appeared on Deep Space 9. Other characters such as Dr Ree are completely original.\nThis is a lengthy book by Trek standards and it can be pretty hard to keep up with all the characters. Unless you like to keep a reference guide handy while you read, I quickly felt disoriented with the number of people I was meeting. So many of them had back stories which I couldn’t quite place to the right character at the right time. Perhaps the authors could have focused on a smaller, core set of characters in this first book, and slowly expanded the crew later. If you are like me and like to read for half an hour before bed, it might take a couple of weeks to finish a book. It’s pretty easy to lose track of all the characters and it can feel frustrating when you need to flick back and remind yourself who’s who in the zoo.\n Although I didn’t love Taking Wing, I did feel it established an interesting crew and interesting characters.  However the diversity of the crew does make it quite fun to read. There are a few soap opera moments between certain characters, which lead me to believe this person and that person may end up together by book X. Some of the personal scenes do feel a bit tacked on, and there to establish certain relationships and tension rather than inform the narrative or drive the main story forward. It many ways it reads a bit like the pilot to a TV show. A TV show called Star Trek Titan I guess.\nAlthough I didn’t love Taking Wing, I did feel it established an interesting crew and interesting characters. Dr Ree distinguished himself as a sure-to-be fan favourite, and the addition of Tuvok added a nice familiarly to an otherwise new crew. I didn’t mind the Tuvok subplot, and generally the book felt more cohesive than Death In Winter.\nThat being said, the TNG relaunch really does at this point feel a bit stuck in the post Nemesis world. I think the series could improve when they make a break from Shinzon this and T’Laura that, and actually go out and do some exploring. Space is the final frontier after all.\nReception Reviews for the book vary from scathing to very positive. Theaker’s Quaterly declared that “Titan’s mission is to make sure nothing interesting happens.” Ouch. Some Kind Of Trek stated that “We get quiet a bit of world building and this is were Mr Mangels and Mr Martin excel.” While Trek Lit said in it’s generally positive review that “I [also] really love the crew of the Titan, and find the diverse species to be interesting and compelling to learn more about.” The book holds a decent Goodreads score of 3.78.\nSales for the book were good.\nThe final verdict Taking Wing is an effective introduction to a huge cast of new characters. It was a bit confusing at times due to so many characters and so many back stories, and Romulan politics just isn’t a hugely appealing subject for me. But the book sets up what seems like an interesting TNG spinoff, and I’m looking forward to the next one.\nLinks http://treksinscifi.com/podcast_notes/?p=176\nhttp://theakersquarterly.blogspot.com/2013/10/star-trek-titan-1-taking-wing-reviewed.html\nhttp://trekclivos79.blogspot.com/2016/08/back-to-books-titans-taking-wing.html\nhttp://trekclivos79.blogspot.com/2016/08/back-to-books-titans-taking-wing.html\n","summary":"Riker finally gets that 4th pip and has left The Enterprise to captain The Titan.

Launched into the far reaches of a satellite galaxy, can Riker steer his crew to safety?\nSpoilers ahead!\nHistory Authors Michael A. Martin \u0026amp; Andy Mangels wrote The Red King back in 2005, right after writing Taking Wing, and at the same time as Christopher L Bennet wrote Orion’s Hounds. While Taking Wing fulfilled its need to honour Nemesis and the subsequent Romulan political fallout, The Red King could focus on exploring the great unknown.\nDuring an interview with Martin on the podcast Literary Treks, Martin revealed that Pocket Books editor Marco Palmieri pulled together a writer’s bible for Titan with input from many authors, including Martin, Mangels, Bennet and David Mack. He couldn’t remember who had created which characters etc., but clearly it was a real team effort. It was up to Mangels and Martin to set the benchmark, tone and general vibe of the Titan novels.\nThe book also is a pseudo-sequel to Mangel and Martin’s earlier Lost Era novel The Sundered. The Neyel people were first discovered in that book by Captain Sulu and the crew of the USS Excelsior, which included Sulu, Tuvok and Akaar.\nStory After Shinzon’s rather naughty experiments with thalaron radiation ripped a hole in the galaxy’s best shirt, Riker and his crew, along with some Klingons and Romulans, get sucked into a spatial anomaly known as The Great Bloom.\nDonatra and Riker form an alliance, which is pleasant enough at first. They discover the Neyel people, a bunch of human’s that did a whole lot of the sort of genetic engineering Bashir from DS9 would have kept under his hat. But life was tough out there in the Small Magellanic Cloud, so they had to adapt or die.\nA burgeoning proto-universe starts putting its finger into our universe’s pie, which puts the Neyel and their neighbourhood in a rather compromising position. So Riker and Donatra launch a rescue effort, converting Vanguard into a makeshift arc. However Donatra doesn’t want word of her detonated warp cores to reach the Klingon’s, so she takes matters into her own hands. Riker isn’t impressed, but he bites his tongue when push comes to shove.\nWith a couple of million Neyel rescued, Riker finds the Titan moto he’s been looking for.\n“Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations.”\nOpinion After the lacklustre Death In Winter and awkward TV pilot feel of Taking Wing, reading The Red King was a breath of fresh air. I liked that it felt very Trekky. It doesn’t have a bad guy as such, more just a set of moral quandaries. Characters are forced to make difficult decisions given near-impossible moral choices. Riker chooses to put his crew at risk to save as many Neyel as he can because he’s Federation and that’s just what they do. Human’s in the future are good.\nThe book is also a nice end to the Titan pilot book/episode. It both respects the Trek of old but brings a nice hit of difference. I laughed when Riker walked onto the bridge while Vale was freaking out about the champagne and overcrowding. Riker was like: “Cool, a party. Queue the jazz music!” Very different from Picard, who would have ordered a full investigation into how such a thing could have occurred.\nAlso, I thought the ship’s Dedication Plaque Motto was going to be “All of you.”\nLet’s look at the scene that inspired Riker’s decision:\n “Thank you, sir. All of you,” Tuvok said, then turned and exited the ready room. \\[…\\] Riker realized he had finally, at long last, found that elusive perfect epigram for Titan’s bridge dedication plaque.”   Excerpt From: “Star Trek: Titan - The Red King.”  I think that would have made an awesome motto. Oh well.\nThe Red King managed to be both a wonderful Trek adventure and a fantastic starting point for the diverse crew of the Titan. In many ways, it was what Taking Wing should have been. The characters behave as they are, rather than get introduced and explained. There are difficult choices to be made. There is betrayal. There is hope. There are very important bracelets.\nI also thought how the Neyel referred to Earth as Auld Aerth was a nice touch. It was a clever little play on language.\nMy two minor gripes are as follows. Firstly, the book does sag just a little in the middle. We change perspective a lot, which gives us little snippet’s of different experiences but doesn’t drive the plot forward. Secondly, I’m not certain Riker would let the murder of the IKS Dugh slide quite so easily. This is Trek, in which a human’s honour and moral code are unshakeable. He did lie to the Klingon’s about what happened, even though Donatra killed them in cold blood.\nReception The Red King received mixed reviews. It holds a lowish score of 3.66 on Goodreads, which does confirm my theory that Goodread’s scores are crazy and one should never pay attention to them. Trek Lit gave it a generally positive review, saying it was “a good conclusion to the beginning of Titan\u0026rsquo;s mission of exploration.” Motion Picture Comics stated, “Mangels \u0026amp; Martin have done an excellent job in setting up the new Titan series.” Trek Today said in their review that “the plot at times shows the strain of trying to tackle a little too much.” While Some Kind Of Trek gave it a just-okay review, saying “All in all a decent read but not probably one you would reread.”\nI enjoyed the book more than most. Sales for the book were below average.\nThe final verdict The Red King, despite some negative online reviews, was a fun read from start to finish, and an improvement on its predecessor Taking Wing. It felt to me like TV era Trek, and that’s not a bad thing.\nLinks  Some Kind Of Trek Review Trek Today Review Motion Picture Comics Review Trek Lit Written Review Trek Lit Podcast / Interview ","summary":"Star Trek Titan finally hits warp speed in this direct follow-up to book #1 Taking Wing.

The original Dune novel was rich, layered and epic: love, lust, betrayal, murder, politics, backstabbing, and that spicy cinnamon-scented melange. It managed to straddle the line between genre fiction and literary fiction, satisfying both sides of its split personality.\nEvidence suggests that Frank Herbert was never interested in writing the Dune sequels. However, from the second book (Dune Messiah) onwards, Herbert pivots to a different kind of storytelling. The Dune sequels are a slow-burn — drawn out and philosophical. Perhaps feeling pressure from his publishers to write more sandy, spice-fueled adventures, Herbert seemed to bury a sense of quiet resentment between the lines.\nAfter finishing the previous entry, Children of Dune, it took me a good while to work up some courage and crack open the covers of this one\u0026hellip; But then I started reading, and I was floored by the power and excitement of the opening scene. God Emperor of Dune begins with a beautifully crafted action piece. Siona and her rebellious friends are running away from Leto\u0026rsquo;s Citadel, chased by a pack of bloodthirsty d-wolves. Based on the book\u0026rsquo;s opening, I was cautiously optimistic it might get less bogged down in pseudo-philosophical ramblings than its predecessor.\nBoy, was I wrong.\nThe book promises a rebellion led by Siona against the 3000-year despotic rule of Leto II. But we quickly leave her behind, and instead, we\u0026rsquo;re subjected to countless \u0026ldquo;room scenes\u0026rdquo; featuring the dull-as-dishwater character Moneo. What are \u0026ldquo;room scenes,\u0026rdquo; you ask? I think of them as scenes not rooted in action. Typically they go like this: Moneo walks into a room. He has a somewhat confusing and long-winded conversation with Leto. Moneo leaves the room. Rinse and repeat.\n\u0026ldquo;Room scenes\u0026rdquo; are the scourge of dull sci-fi stories. The Star Wars prequels were criticised for too many \u0026ldquo;room scenes\u0026rdquo;. The Honest Trailer of Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones sums it up nicely:\n [\u0026hellip;] Strap yourself in for [\u0026hellip;] People sitting and talking\u0026hellip; Standing and talking\u0026hellip; Walking and talking\u0026hellip; One person standing and talking while another is sitting and talking\u0026hellip; People standing and talking then taking a seat for more talking\u0026hellip;\n The book is crammed with long, talky scenes overflowing with pseudo-philosophical dialogue that barely advances the plot. However, the appearance of Duncan (in ghola form, of course) does introduce some tension as he steadfastly refuses to bend the knee and acknowledge Leto as the god-emperor supreme.\nAnd yet, despite its shortcomings, I found myself having a pretty fun time reading it. There are some positives. For starters, the story is a lot less confusing than Children of Dune. And when the action does pick up, such as the scene in which Duncan climbs the great wall to take a shot at Leto before his wedding, it is genuinely exhilarating.\n And yet, despite its shortcomings, I found myself having a pretty fun time reading it.  God Emperor of Dune could have been a lot more interesting if we\u0026rsquo;d stayed, at least in part, with Siona and her band of rebels. It\u0026rsquo;s a shame the book focuses almost solely on Leto, with a supporting cast of Duncan, Moneo and Hwi. The book teases with entertainment and then bludgeons the reader with tedium.\nTo further demonstrate my point: there is a great scene where Malky is brought in. The old, curmudgeonly Ixian ambassador doesn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to give Leto a piece of his mind. He\u0026rsquo;s a great character, unafraid to tell it like it is. But of course, he only lasts one scene before he\u0026rsquo;s nixed. That\u0026rsquo;s how it goes with the Dune sequels; a brief flash of joy snuffed out before it has time to shine.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also evident that the Dune books will never build out the broader Dune fictional universe. Herbert\u0026rsquo;s world-building is unparalleled, but we never get to experience that world. Instead, we remain stuck on Arrakis. We never get to visit Ix, Caladan or Tleilax. We never spend any meaningful time with members of the Guild as they traverse space or the Bene Gesserit as they do their thing. Instead, it\u0026rsquo;s always an Atreides, always on Arrakis, always talking and rarely doing anything.\nGod Emperor of Dune is an average book, which leverages the power of the original Dune to keep the reader interested. As a result, it\u0026rsquo;s a difficult book to rate. As I turned the pages, I thought about what rating I might give it. I fluctuated between 2.5 stars to 4 stars. In the end, I am a big Dune fan, and I guess I\u0026rsquo;m willing to forgive its flaws because it\u0026rsquo;s nice to be back in that world again.

DeCandido with an idea. How about we make a book which is The West Wing in space. Subsequent editor Marco Palmieri would eventually see the book through to completion.\nSomething of a curious standalone novel, Articles Of The Federation was DeCandido’s attempt to show the inner workings of Federation politics. This side of Trek was rarely seen in much detail on screen. An of course The West Wing was an obvious cultural touchstone for this kind of storytelling. So, DeCandido went to work on writing what would become Articles Of The Federation.\nDeCandido, the author of 9 previous Trek novels, stated in an interview that he based the character of Federation President Nan Bacco on his great grandmother. He also stated that he was a fan of The West Wing and generally became something of a news junky around election time.\nStory After the last Federation president accidentally mailed an arsenal of deadly super-weapons to a planet that probably shouldn’t have had them, the bombastic Nan Bacco takes office. She has won a tight electoral race and must set about navigating the world of politics whilst talking about baseball whenever she possibly can.\nA bunch of Remans, also former Shinzon loyalists, borrow their uncle\u0026rsquo;s jalopy of a spaceship and start heading to Federation space at warp 3. However, the Klingons are technically their protectorate so that causes a bit of a diplomatic headache. Furthermore, a race of people who have a thing for sla/sh/ing their wor/ds, the Trinni/Ek keep having an allergic reaction to the horderves served at Federation functions.\nA journalist gets wind of the aforementioned political coverup, a trade agreement with a bunch of nasty slavers gets shredded, and there is an awful lot of people watching Illuminating The City Of Light. It’s good to know cable TV news shows are still a thing 400 years from now.\nOpinion In some ways, it’s difficult to review a book like Articles Of The Federation. On one hand, it’s well written and very thoughtful. It manages to combine many different viewpoints and explores in-depth a side of Star Trek we rarely get to see in detail but is alluded to many times.\nIn another way, the book was at times boring and a bit derivative. Read any review online and The West Wing is mentioned every single time without fail. It’s such an obvious homage to that show. I personally loved The West Wing but that doesn’t mean I want to see it replicated and retrofitted into a Star Trek book.\nUltimately I think the biggest issue was the simple lack of a through-line in the story. DeCandido weaves a complex thread of different storylines, but they start and end at different points. I think a bigger umbrella plot was needed to tie the story together. For example, the Remans could have somehow affected the coverup of the previous president, which could have affected the Trinni/Ek’s decision to join the Federation. Maybe there could have been some higher stakes. What if the Trinni/Ek controlled the other major source of Kellinite, so to break ties with the nasty Aligar’s, they had to convince the Trinni/Ek to join the Federation despite the mistakes of the previous president.\n I personally loved The West Wing but that doesn’t mean I want to see it replicated and retrofitted into a Star Trek book.  What I am getting at is simply that the story could have come together into a more cohesive whole, rather than feeling like a selection of loosely connected short stories.\nOn the positive side though, there is no doubt DeCandido is a natural-born writer, with a stellar grasp of Star Trek detail. The book is littered with Easter eggs for hardcore fans, but none of them has the required knowledge for one to enjoy the story.\nI have always felt science fiction and space opera as a whole has rarely explored the topic of journalism. The fourth estate is such an important part of any modern liberal democracy. So I enjoyed spending some time with some brave, truth-seeking journalists and exploring the nuances of the importance of truth vs the damage that the truth may cause.\nAs with many other people, I found the standout characters from the book to be the president Nan Bacco and her steadfast chief of staff Esperanza Piñiero. I’m happy to say we’ll be seeing them again in the upcoming Destiny trilogy.\nReception Articles Of The Federation received generally positive reviews. At the time of publishing this review, it has an impressive 4.08 rating on Goodreads. Trek Lit Reviews stated that the book has “firmly established itself as one of my all-time favorite Star Trek novels.” Library Is Unknown Right described it as “an interesting look at a rarely explored corner of the Star Trek universe.” In a short but glowing review, J.L. Gribble stated that “This was a dense read, but maintained a fast pace […] with enough drama that it never dragged.”\nBook sales were poor. This is backed up by DeCandido himself, who stated in an interview the book was well-reviewed and liked by fans, but performed poorly sales-wise.\nI think part of the reason why the book sold poorly was because a) It was not associated with a specific Star Trek iteration and b) it had a pretty boring front cover.\nThe final verdict DeCandido himself has described this book as a commercial flop, yet a book that had wide-ranging implications for the Star Trek litverse. I don’t disagree. Nan Bacco and the Federation’s political system is the star of the show here, and the book helped pave the way for future stories to incorporate these elements.\nThat said, I just wish the overall story was a bit more compelling. It’s a well written, clever read filled with lots of lovingly researched and thought out detail. It just didn’t keep me turning the pages.\nLinks  J.L.

Will Riker and his team of diverse Starfleet personnel must now face a band of space whalers, who aim their long harpoons at the poor old Space Jellies from TNG season 1 episode 1.\nSpoilers ahead!\nHistory Back in 2006, Christopher L Bennet wrote this third Titan novel at about the same time as Martin and Mangel\u0026rsquo;s wrote the first two (Taking Wing and The Red King). Bennet himself described the book as still part of the “pilot” for the Titan series. I guess all three books were a long multi-part special. And true enough, it was the first book that made true on Titan’s promise to go where no one had gone before. Except they don’t really because the species they encounter is from the very first episode of TNG! Anyway…\nEditor Marco Palmieri’s set the goal for the Titan series early on: Tell sci-fi stories with a focus on exploration rather than Federation politics and feature a highly diverse crew. Bennet’s work on the previous Star Trek book Ex Machina displayed some of the good stuff Palmieri was looking for, so he invited Bennet on board to help launch Titan into the great unknown.\nThe theme of the novel explores the relationship between hunter-warrior cultures and their prey. This was a theme Bennet has explored before in his Trek short story The Spirit Of The Hunt.\nStory Since I read this book some time ago, I can only remember the broad strokes of the story. But it goes a bit like this…\nTitan is off heading towards the Bubble Gum Nebula when, without warning, all the psychic members of the crew come down with a serious migraine. It turns out that a race of space creatures, sometimes called “star jellies” (why!?) are being hunted down, killed, and then retrofitted into space ships.\nUpon encountering this twisted horror-show version of Pimp My Ride, Riker confronts the hunters and tells them to stop turning these sentient beings into zombie spaceships. However, he learns that these people are reliant on them for survival. They use them to attack even bigger, more dangerous space jellies - the kind that considers eating up an entire planet for breakfast part of their daily wellness routine.\nTo help them get through it, Troi teaches Tuvok a few tricks of the trade when it comes to controlling his psychic powers, and Riker eventually manages to broker peace between the cosmic bowls of jello and their hunters.\nOpinion When I first picked up Orion’s Hounds, I thought the book started very strong. I felt like it was on track to be one of my absolute favourites. It was like good old Trek in many ways. A mysterious encounter affects a bunch of the crew, they slowly unravel the mystery and find a peaceful resolution.\nHowever, I found the book, particularly towards the end, spent way too much time with the Pa’haquel. It engages the rather boring trope of meeting a bunch of people who are the backwards, old fashioned types that humans once were. And it also manages to push this notion of hunters as animal-loving conservationists who worship the animals that they kill. This idea of the noble hunter just isn’t something that particularly gels with me. We’ve gone from saving the whale(s) in Star Trek IV to cruising around space in the carcasses of zombie-space-whales. Ugh…\nIt was such a weird read. An excellent first half but a long, dragging second half.\n We’ve gone from saving the whale(s) in Star Trek IV to cruising around space in the carcasses of zombie-space-whales.  Also, by the third book, one gets a bit bored about hearing how diverse the crew of Titan are. Yes, they are very diverse… Incredibly diverse… we get it! While it is an interesting point of difference, I’d like to see the diversity have a concrete impact on the story rather than constantly mentioned in the ancillary moments.\nI actually skim-read the last few chapters of the book. The damn thing felt like it was never going to end! That being said, the book is well written, has an interesting premise and does a good job with some characters such as Ree, Troi and Tuvok. It could have been a great read but wound up being just average for me.\nReception The book has received fairly positive reviews online. Trek Lit described it as “easily one of the best of the modern Star Trek novel era.” Unreality SF said in a glowing review that it was “the first real highlight of the Titan series.” In a more critical review, Jim’s Books / Shashtrix said that it was “fairly average on the scale of Star Trek novels.” It holds a decent Goodreads score of 3.79.\nBook sales were below average\nThe final verdict With an interesting premise and an engaging first act, I thought Orion’s Hounds was truly going to deliver on Titan’s promise and potential. However, I was disappointed to find the book to be overly long and filled with generic alien characters I cared little for. It could have been something great but didn’t quite manage to keep me reading until the end.\nLinks  https://christopherlbennett.wordpress.com/home-page/star-trek-fiction/ttn-orions-hounds/ http://www.treklit.com/2019/07/orions-hounds.html http://unreality-sf.net/2008/03/15/star-trek-orions-hounds-review/ https://www.shastrix.com/books/book.php?id=19 ","summary":"Now that the Dominion War is over, Starfleet can get back to good old exploration.

But this time they are faster, meaner and more adaptable. Will their new queen ascend to the throne and doom Earth to assimilation?\nSpoilers ahead!\nHistory J.M. Dillard is the pen name under which Jeanne Kalogridis publishes her Star Trek novels. As such, one could interpret her J.M. Dillard moniker to be her Star Trek name. This may be backed up by the fact that she has written eight novelisations of Star Trek movies and episodes, along with eight original Star Trek fiction novels. Movie/episode novelisations somehow speak “writer for sale” to me… does she have the passion and drive to deliver a really great Trek story?\nOn the other hand, one may see it as a marketing tool. Jeanne Kalogridis seems to focus on romance and urban fantasy, which may have made her (or her publisher) fearful that she would be poorly received by the male-dominant Star Trek fanbase. In any case, Dillard wrote Resistance back in 2007 and lays the groundwork for the next few novels which will all strongly focus on The Borg. Story The crew are shifting around! Worf turns down Picard’s offer to be the new Number One, because he feels a bit embarrassed that his touchy-feely side caused him to save his wife during the Dominion War (Dax from Deep Space 9) and a few people might have sort of died as a consequence. Meanwhile, T’Lana shows up and quickly becomes probably the worst ship’s counsellor ever to stalk the halls of the starship Enterprise.\nPicard’s internal radio seems permanently configured to the Borg’s in-house station, and he soon finds a Borg ship birthing a new queen. As the queen is still a metaphorical larva in the metaphorical royal jelly, Picard devises a plan to take her out before she can pop that crown on her fully developed head.\nThere are a couple of noob characters, the Italian stereotype Battaglia gets assimilated, causing his newly Facebook-official Sara to swear revenge. Picard becomes Locutus again so he can sneak onto the Borg ship and take out the queen. Worf pulls a cloaking device out of nowhere (get it?) and Battaglia and Nave take the plunge (get it?).\nFinally, Worf concedes that maybe Picard needs a warrior by his side, so he takes the gig after all.\nOpinion The Borg are introduced into the post-Nemesis litverse with this book, and by the end of it, I was already Borged out. I get that they are a popular antagonist and it makes sense for this run of books to play it safe and focus on the Borg. But that being said, the story here is just not very engaging.\nThere isn’t much explanation how a Borg ship just materialised in Federation space. And then there is the clunky description of them “birthing a new queen” with the inevitable comparison to bees and beehives. Picard shrugs his shoulders and becomes Locutus, even though being forced to become Locutus was the worst day of his life. Yes, the first away mission failed (surprise surprise) but there didn’t seem to be any particularly good reason for him to choose that path. Perhaps Dillard pitched the idea \u0026ldquo;Picard must become Locutus again\u0026rdquo; but wasn’t quite able to craft a great story around that concept.\nWorf also somehow pulls out a hidden cloaking device, despite them being banned by the Federation. How convenient for the story!\n A Vulcan counsellor is a clever idea if done right. But the story didn’t give her the arc she needed.  Ok, so the plot wasn’t the best. But more annoying than a holey plot is how the book portrays certain characters. Picard “misses Troi terribly” according to this book. But Picard’s mentor was usually the underrated character of Guinan. Here we get a Picard who is unsure of himself one minute, but then without much prompting takes a huge risk in becoming Locutus. He disobeys sensible orders from Starfleet and divides his crew. T’Lana is also a troublesome character. I wanted to like her. A Vulcan counsellor is a clever idea if done right. But the story didn’t give her the arc she needed. Probably because she was right in her defiance of Picard’s rogue plans.\nThe new characters of Battaglia and Nave are interesting enough, even if Battaglia was a bit of a stereotypical Italian character. But their story was predictable. Predictability is not always bad when the author gives the reader something that they signed up for. When someone picks up a Star Trek book, they expect aliens, a moral quandary and maybe a space battle or two. A doomed romance is not a big part of Trek, so readers don’t want to see that aspect introduced unless it’s done originally. Yes, it was predictable that the crew of The Enterprise would prevail, but that\u0026rsquo;s because we, as readers, sign up to see that happen. We don’t sign up to see a doomed romance play itself out in a predictable way. One thing I cannot fault is the tight, efficient writing style of Dillard. She is a talented stringer of words. I breezed through the book in no time (it was pretty short though). There was no fat. Dillard prefers to write chapters that are comprised of small scenes that slowly paint a broader picture. Personally, it’s not my favourite writing style, but it creates a fast-moving, sweeping narrative that keeps the pages turning. On a technical level, this book is well written. I just wish the plot and the characters were of the same standard. Reception The book has received mixed reviews online. It has a 3.69 score on Goodreads. Space and Sorcery said, “While the main theme for this novel looked promising, this story unfortunately did not completely deliver on that promise.” In a review I personally agreed with, Trek Movie states “It’s tight, a quick read, and one that will keep your attention… except that it just fails to pioneer any new ground.” Trek Lit similarly said, “Resistance was an interesting read with plenty of action and high stakes, but at times the story felt rushed and a bit aimless.\u0026quot; Sales were average, about the same as Death In Winter or Titan: The Red King.\nThe final verdict Dillard is a writer of obvious talent. Therefore it was a shame to see beloved characters poorly realised and a story that felt rushed. It’s by no means a terrible book. If I didn’t think too hard about it, the book was a quick and fun read. But once I’d given the story and characters some thought, it just didn’t hold up.\nLinks  Space and Sorcery Trek Movie Trek Lit ","summary":"The Borg are back.

DeCandido do the near-impossible and write a decent Q novel?\nSpoilers ahead!\nHistory Seasoned Trek author Keith R.A. DeCandido penned Q\u0026amp;A shortly after writing the standalone novel Articles Of The Federation. DeCandido was approached by Pocketbooks editor Margaret Clark to write a post-nemesis novel. DeCandido pitched the idea of taking a little break from the Borg (crazy right) and explore the reason why Q was always so interested in humanity and Picard in particular.\nInterestingly, DeCandido also did some freelance editing at Pocketbooks, so he would have been kept in the loop regarding the post Nemesis litverse.\nAfter writing the book, he made a few changes so it fits in with the previous novel Resistance.\nStory The mysterious They/Them beings, even more powerful than the Q, are whipping a fresh batch of universes up every time a universe fails to entertain them.\nMeanwhile, Picard and his crew finally leave the dregs of Romulan politics at the bottom of the glass and take their space-Uber Enterprise out to Gorsach IX. Turns out the planet resembles is all symmetrical lines and perfect symmetry.\nOf course, Q shows up and starts nattering away, doing quirky Q things and generally being a pest. Worf suggests that they ignore Q, as one might ignore a petulant child or a door-to-door salesman.\nT’Lana is impressed that Worf keeps his phaser holstered every time Q calls him “micro brain”.\nA bunch of quantum fissures fizzle and pop into the world, and suddenly there are Enterprises everywhere. Picard is absconded off and put in front of Them/They. Q reveals that his true intentions all this time was to manoeuvre humanity into proving their shared universe shouldn’t end up in Them/They’s compost heap.\nPicard has a laugh and the world is saved.\nOpinion The first thing I noticed about Q\u0026amp;A was just how good DeCandido is at writing what I think of as Star Trek’s “soap opera scenes.” You know, the scenes where Troi and Riker take a bubble bath or Geordi bombs out with a girl on the holodeck. I really enjoyed the scene with Picard \u0026amp; Crusher eating breakfast in bed (croissants and coffee, oui oui). It was a cleverly crafted scene that showed Picard’s progress as a character, without it feeling out of character. And of course, as soon as the Starfleet uniform goes on, Picard’s smile turns flat as a ruler.\nDeCandido also did a great job with the new characters. Unlike the previous novel Resistance, I felt that T’Lana was finally growing on me. Similarly, we got to see a different side of Leybenzon; an ass at work but an alright guy once the drinks are flowing. La Forge is having some trouble adjusting to the new crew but softens his stance towards Leybenzon and Kadohata.\n DeCandido’s grasp of the characters is near perfect; he can show us another side of a beloved character like Picard without feeling like we’re seeing someone else on the page  The only other DeCandido book I’ve read is Articles Of The Federation, which I felt was well written but a bit aimless. This book actually had a very simple storyline. But it was done well and goes to show a simple story can be very effective. It was well-paced and always grounded in a solid through-line. As stated above, DeCandido’s grasp of the characters is near perfect; he can show us another side of a beloved character like Picard without feeling like we’re seeing someone else on the page.\nThe book does have a couple of downsides though. Quite a few scenes are featuring semi-random characters all stumbling across the quantum fissure. Each scene is well written and interesting enough, but it does feel like they\u0026rsquo;re a bit of filler. Rather than advancing the plot, you realise pretty quickly they are all finding the same phenomena and ending up facing the same consequences.\nAlso, the book is littered with an abundance of Q easter eggs. If you aren\u0026rsquo;t familiar with Star Trek: Voyager and the role Q played, it would be easy to feel a bit overwhelmed. Easter eggs are great when they are a neat bonus, but they can be a bit annoying if you just don\u0026rsquo;t get the references.\nDeCandido also dreamed big with this book, essentially tieing all the Q stories together and giving them a single, specific purpose. It was a big, gutsy move. Did it work? Honestly, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have minded if the stakes were lower. The book could have been just as enjoyable if the universe weren\u0026rsquo;t about to end or if Q was not in fact executing a grand plan. I didn\u0026rsquo;t mind the \u0026ldquo;bigness\u0026rdquo; of the story, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think it necessarily added a lot.\nReception Q\u0026amp;A received mostly positive reviews online. It holds a respectable 3.80 on Goodreads (which is a bit low I think). Trek Movie said, \u0026ldquo;this novel should have been the first Next Generation relaunch novel.\u0026rdquo; Sci-Fi Crows Nest said, \u0026ldquo;Don’t worry too much about the main plot with its lack of drama, just enjoy life on the Enterprise.\u0026rdquo; In a glowing review, TrekLit stated, \u0026ldquo;Q \u0026amp; A exceeded my expectations.\u0026rdquo; However Sci-Fi Online gave it a negative review, \u0026ldquo;All in all a disappointing book that just confirms that this is how the Universe ends - not with a bang, but with a whimper.\u0026rdquo;\nBook sales were low, which is a shame considering what a fun read it was.\nThe final verdict All in all, Q\u0026amp;A was a fun outing, and probably my favourite post-Nemesis Trek book so far. It was well balanced, full of great scenes and had an interesting story. At times it did feel a bit \u0026ldquo;padded out\u0026rdquo; and not everyone will love the ending.

And now only Seven of Nine can stop them, with a little help from her friends.\nSpoilers ahead!\nHistory Peter David is practically Trek Lit royalty. He penned the well-loved and respected standalone TNG novels Vendetta and Imzadi amongst many others. In fact, he was such a popular writer, Pocket Books editor John Ordover gave him the honour of creating and writing an entire literary spin-off series New Frontier, which numbers an impressive 21 entries.\nAnd so Peter David was tasked with writing an entry into this new relaunch timeline that would continue on the Borg story from Resistance. This would be the last TNG novel David would write (although he wrote a handful of New Frontier novels after this one).\nStory Janeway is off to inspect the Borg ship that Picard, erm, disabled in an earlier novel. Despite the fact that the Borg Queen is deceased, it turns out the ship was just playing dead. And when it awakens, it assimilates Janeway.\nSeven of Nine\u0026rsquo;s spider-sense tells her Janeway is in trouble. Ruh-roh. So she grabs her hidden stash of gold-pressed latinum and rushes off in a ship owned by some dude called Grim Vargo, a character lifted straight out of Firefly.\nAt some point, Picard gets wind of the situation and tries to help Seven out. They defy Starfleet orders yet again, (Picard Y U so naughty?) and concoct a hair-brained scheme to nab the doomsday machine and turn that bad boy loose on the Borg ship. All the least likable characters on the Enterprise mutiny. Meanwhile, the Borg ship now absorbs rather than assimilates. It eats Pluto. But Seven and the Doomsday machine start getting along just swell, so it puts the Borg ship down, but not before Janeway is nixed.\nLady Q bookends the novel, both causing Janeway to enter the Borg ship and also taking her off into the, ahem, afterlife. As it were. Because she is totally really dead.\nOh and Spock is there for some reason..?\nOpinion Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s not mince words here. This book is an absolute clunker. Out of all the Trek books I have read so far, this is the first novel I\u0026rsquo;ve read that was simply poorly written. While I disliked Resistance for its story and depiction of certain characters, it was not a badly written book. It just makes some creative mistakes.\nBefore Dishonour is waffly and tediously over-the-top. Some of the dialogue has to be read to be believed such a thing could survive the editorial process. I understand David is known to write lighter, more comedy focused Trek. And I have no problem with Trek comedies. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is my favourite Trek movie.\nHowever, this book is just plain silly in parts. I didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy the character of Grim Vargo, who felt like a Firefly rip-off shunted into the Star Trek universe. I also didn\u0026rsquo;t particularly appreciate how the first third of the novel focuses on Seven of Nine, despite this being a TNG novel.\n This book undoes a lot of the good work set up in DeCandido's preceding Q\u0026A novel  I can\u0026rsquo;t entirely blame David though. It\u0026rsquo;s obvious that many seasoned Trek writers struggled with the new relaunch style of individual books all set within a larger, multi-book arc.\nAnd then there is the ending, featuring Lady Q and Janeway walking off into something like the afterlife. Apparently, a lot of fans were pretty cheesed off that they killed Janeway\u0026hellip; which is weird because although yes, technically she dies at the end of the book, it\u0026rsquo;s quite obvious that she will be resurrected at some point by the Q or something like that. However, I do agree that it seemed weird to kill off a prominent canon character like Janeway in a TNG novel rather than a Voyager novel.\nAlso, bizarrely enough, there is a rumour that David was initially told to kill Janeway off in the novel. Like completely dead forever. But then when focus groups reacted badly to this decision, they backtracked. This might explain the awkward inclusion of Lady Q. However this is just a rumour and I haven\u0026rsquo;t found any solid evidence to confirm this.\nUnfortunately in regards to the new Enterprise crew such as Kadohata, Leybenzon, and T\u0026rsquo;Lana, this book undoes a lot of the good work set up in DeCandido\u0026rsquo;s preceding Q\u0026amp;A novel. They become very unlikeable (again) in this book. I have a feeling David was directed to continue the \u0026ldquo;new guys don\u0026rsquo;t fit in\u0026rdquo; story set up in Resistance.\nHowever, there were a couple of redeeming parts. Firstly, the comedy does occasionally land with some offbeat zeal. The scene where Worf was ordered to assume command of the Enterprise, to which he responded with something like, \u0026ldquo;I cannot, my foot is asleep\u0026rdquo; was a genuine laugh out loud moment for me. Secondly, the story did start to hit its stride in the final act. Seven bonding with the doomsday machine was well done. An exciting array of short, sharp chapters kept the story\u0026rsquo;s tempo high and pulsing towards the end.\nReception Before Dishonor received mostly negative reviews online. In a short but scathing review, StarTrek.com described it as, \u0026ldquo;[\u0026hellip;] one of the weakest Star Trek novels of recent time.\u0026rdquo; While Trek Lit said, \u0026ldquo;For me, Before Dishonor greatly misses the mark.\u0026rdquo; Games Radar said in a somewhat more positive review, \u0026ldquo;Any space opera that features the line The bastards ate Pluto! must be doing something right. [\u0026hellip; but] as it is, there’s too much stodge to get through before the fine cuisine.\u0026rdquo; However Sci-Fi Online gave it a positive review stating, \u0026ldquo;The book’s 400 pages contain some padding, but on the whole, this is a very exciting read.\u0026rdquo;\nBook sales were above average, perhaps due to Peter David\u0026rsquo;s popularity as a Trek author.\nThe final verdict I\u0026rsquo;m not ready to give up on Peter David. I will hopefully one day give his New Frontier series a go. However, Before Dishonor is simply a poorly executed book. It muddles an over-the-top storyline that struggles to find congruency with the larger, multi-book arc.

In this Titan novel, the sword is \u0026ldquo;Erykon\u0026rsquo;s Eye\u0026rdquo;, and it dangles above an entire planet, threatening to unleash its awesome wrath. And Titan is caught in the crossfire.\nSpoilers ahead!\nHistory It\u0026rsquo;s hard to find much information about author Geoffrey Thorne. He has only written one Star Trek novel (this one). The book was written back in 2007. I believe Thorne had a Trek short story published in a Simon \u0026amp; Schuster anthology, and that presumably lead to the offer to write a full-length novel.\nOther than Trek, Thorne has written a smattering of short stories, tv scripts and comics. He was also once an actor!\nIn any case, he no longer appears to be active in the creative writing space. This is the fourth Titan novel all up, and it was a two-year gap between this one and the preceding novel, Orion\u0026rsquo;s Hounds.\nStory The Titan is merrily flying about the galaxy, but becomes stuck in some cosmic quicksand and can\u0026rsquo;t seem to pull itself out. Warp is a no go. The crew determine the source of the spatial anomaly is coming from the nearby planet of Orisha.\nSo they send a team out with the task of making contact with the Orishans. But they\u0026rsquo;re attacked and they dive into the anomaly for cover, only to find they have been sent back in time. Jaza and Modan are 1000 years in the past, but the rest only slip back by a few days.\nFrom here the story gets a little bit twisty. Modan manages to get back to the present, but Jaza stayed behind, in part thanks to a vision from the Bajoran Prophets. Meanwhile, Titan learns that the ship protecting the Eye is in fact a living being, of a sort anyway. They put the poor thing out of its misery, and Titan finally manages to get its warp engines humming again.\nOpinion I have mixed feelings about Sword of Damocles. Thorne writes with a real literary flair, and generally, it\u0026rsquo;s a joy to read. To book has a stunning opening chapter where we learn about Jaza\u0026rsquo;s past, his involvement with the Bajoran war and his spiritual beliefs.\nBut then some chapters tend to get a bit bogged down in florid, aureate prose. There is an old creative writing adage: Show, don\u0026rsquo;t tell. There were a few times where it was all \u0026ldquo;tell\u0026rdquo; and no \u0026ldquo;show\u0026rdquo;. I think the book could have benefited from a few more scenes with characters actually interacting.\nThe other issue is that the story was a bit confusing at times. I enjoyed the twisty, time travel aspects of the story. But there were a few moments where I had to stop and review what I had just read.\nI felt like I understood the story quite well. But then I listened to the excellent Literary Treks podcast review. They recapped the story and l realised that I had in fact missed a few nuances of the plot. It was nothing major but really goes to show just how layered the story was.\nBasically, this kind of story will be a bit divisive. On the whole, I liked it, but I do think it could have benefitted from a bit more clarity.\n l realised that I had in fact missed a few nuances of the story  All that being said, the book does an excellent job focusing on the character of Jaza. The way Thorne dealt with Jaza\u0026rsquo;s religiosity was very clever. He managed to explore Jaza\u0026rsquo;s religious beliefs in a nuanced and respectful way, while also incorporating them into the plot.\nI also thought it was a great choice to focus on one main character (Jaza) rather than constantly changing perspectives to different Titan crew. You would think a novel, being a long-form medium, would suit shifting perspectives amongst a large cast of characters. But I found having a single main character really helped give the book a sense of focus. It seems like they may continue this approach with the next book.\nMaybe Sword of Damocles did bite off more than it could chew. It is very clever but tries to be so clever it\u0026rsquo;s almost subversive. Maybe Thorne could have scaled the ambition back just a smidge, and the book would have won a few more fans.\nThe last thing I\u0026rsquo;ll say is that I thought it was a mistake to leave Jaza in the past. As Trek Lit pointed out, we\u0026rsquo;re losing a character in each Titan book. It undermines all the good work Thorne did in this book, bringing Jaza\u0026rsquo;s character to life and making the audience feel a connection to him. What a shame not to see him again (I assume, anyway!).\nReception Online reviews of this book were mixed. Sci-Fi Online said, \u0026ldquo;Despite these flaws, and the fact that the story is rather slow to kick off, Sword of Damocles is ultimately rewarding.\u0026rdquo; Motion Picture Comics described the book as, \u0026ldquo;[\u0026hellip;] another strong, enjoyable instalment in this series of novels.\u0026rdquo; However, Unreality SF gave it a negative review, \u0026ldquo;Sword of Damocles is an utter disappointment.\u0026rdquo;\nThe book enjoys an \u0026ldquo;Above Average\u0026rdquo; rating on Trek BBS. Book sales were modest, which might explain my Thorne did not write any more Trek novels.\nThe final verdict Sword of Damocles was an ambitious read with literary ambitions, and it may have bitten off a bit more than it could chew. However it did an excellent job bringing Jaza\u0026rsquo;s character to life, and the story was compelling\u0026hellip; even if at times a bit confusing.

Can Christopher L. Bennett tie together the previous books, set up the forthcoming Destiny trilogy, and save the litverse from ruin?\nSpoilers ahead!\nHistory Editor Margaret Clark offered Bennet the opportunity to write this instalment of the relaunch timeline back in 2007-2008. The relaunch timeline had, thus far, met with limited success. Book sales were modest and fans found the new characters unpalatable. Additionally, I\u0026rsquo;m guessing everybody was getting sick of the Borg.\nBennet said one goal in writing Greater Than The Sum was to, \u0026ldquo;give readers a greater understanding and appreciation of characters and events from its preceding novels.\u0026rdquo; It seems everybody agreed someone had to tie up the loose ends and get this literary franchise back on track.\nRecognising Borg fatigue amongst the fans, Bennet also stated that the Borg would take a back seat in the story. Instead, it would introduce a new character, T’Ryssa Chen, and a new form of life; a kind of computerised planetary intelligence with a keen interest in the topic of procreation (more on that later).\nBennet also consulted with David Mack, who was busy clacking away on his keyboard, dreaming up the forthcoming Destiny trilogy. Mr Bennet certainly had his work cut out for him writing this one.\nStory The story starts by introducing T’Ryssa Chen, a half-Vulcan/half-human, who thoroughly eschews her Vulcan side. She blags her way onto an away mission to alleviate her bridge duty boredom. Once on the planet, they meet some rather friendly and curious creatures (Noh Angels), but then the Borg show up and totally ruin the party.\nThese Noh Angels save T\u0026rsquo;Ryssa from the Borg using their awesome technological abilities. Meanwhile, T\u0026rsquo;Ryssa\u0026rsquo;s ship (the U.S.S. Rhea) is partially assimilated. Eventually, T\u0026rsquo;Ryssa winds up aboard the Enterprise, whose mission is three-fold; destroy the assimilated ship Einstein, rescue the Rhea, and defeat the Borg.\nHowever, the Noh Angels have other ideas. They prefer people to be peaceful; so they keep the Borg and the Enterprise apart. Meanwhile, the Borg are drilling into the Angel\u0026rsquo;s planetary brain, sucking out all that gooey and delicious technological goodness. Picard, with Chen\u0026rsquo;s help, must convince the peace-loving Noh Angels to release their grip and let the Enterprise take care of business.\nThey are partially successful. Although the Borg cube is defeated, the book\u0026rsquo;s concluding epilogue ends with Leybenzon dying on another Borg ship, having accidentally delivered the Federation\u0026rsquo;s secret weapon right into their hands.\nOpinion The first few chapters of Greater Than The Sum spend much of their time apologizing for the previous books, almost retconning them. Bennett covers aspects such as T\u0026rsquo;Lana\u0026rsquo;s short stint as ships counsellor, Leybenzons resignation, inconsistencies with the Borg, and a few other bits and bobs. I admire the idea; clean up some of the past wrongs and create a more congruent continuity. However, the book\u0026rsquo;s first act did get a bit bogged down in the detail.\n Perhaps the message could have been a bit more balanced.  Bennet also introduces the new character of T\u0026rsquo;Ryssa Chen. She\u0026rsquo;s sassy, quirky, and very un-Vulcan. Her character was, at times, a bit over-the-top. But she was still a huge improvement over the dull and unlikeable T\u0026rsquo;Lana and Leybenzon. I was glad that Bennet restricted the new characters to a single person. Like Sword Of Damocles, I found that focusing on a single character helped to centre the story.\nThe book focuses heavily on the theme of family, children and procreation. This theme is woven into every chapter. For example, Chen has daddy issues, Picard fears the Borg incursion makes having a family too risky, and The Noh Angels just can\u0026rsquo;t seem to wrap their heads around the whole procreation thing. Additionally, the liberated Borg (E.g. Hugh and his partner) are searching for a way to reproduce to keep their society going. This leads up to Crusher falling pregnant just as the Borg launch a devastating incursion into Federation space. Queue the forthcoming Destiny trilogy.\nAlthough I appreciated Bennet\u0026rsquo;s dedication to a central theme, I had two minor quibbles. Firstly, the theme lacked subtlety and was too enmeshed in every aspect of the story. Secondly, the book pushes a single message; children are great and wondrous and you should have children even if a) You spend most of your life away from them on a starship or b) the Borg are coming to eff you up and murder everyone you love.\nPerhaps the message could have been a bit more balanced.\nAll that being said, Bennet does many good things with Greater Than The Sum. He brings one of his trademark big, wacky ideas (sentient, naturally forming planetary computers anyone?) and integrates it into an entertaining story. His original creation, T\u0026rsquo;Ryssa Chen, is a breath of fresh air. The book was tighter than Bennet\u0026rsquo;s previous novel Star Trek: Titan: Orion\u0026rsquo;s Hounds, which I appreciated.\nReception Greater Than The Sum received generally positive reviews online. It holds an impressive \u0026ldquo;outstanding\u0026rdquo; rating on Trek BBS, with many people praising the new character of Chen. Trek Movie gave it a positive review, stating it featured, \u0026ldquo;[..] a unique new construct, effective use of thread-bare villains, and a heavy dose of character development.\u0026rdquo; Trek Lit also gave it a glowing review, stating that the book, \u0026ldquo;[\u0026hellip;] turned out to be a very thoughtful and compelling story.\u0026rdquo; However, Unreality Sc-Fi were not such big fans, \u0026ldquo;To say Greater than the Sum was an utter disappointment would be a huge understatement\u0026rdquo;.\nBook sales were again modest, as was the case for most relaunch Trek novels at this point.\nThe final verdict Greater Than The Sum is, despite its imperfections, one of the stronger entries in the post-Nemesis litverse. It features a welcome cast shakeup with the introduction of Chen, who was a bit over-the-top, but still an enjoyable addition to the Enterprise crew. The story was original, entertaining and it cleverly moved the Borg into the back seat so it could focus on more original ideas. Yes, the book\u0026rsquo;s theme(s) lacked subtlety, but it was still a fun adventure with plenty of big concepts and thought-provoking moments.\nLinks  Trek BBS Review Thread Trek Movie Review Trek Lit Review (+ podcast link) Unreality Sci-Fi Review Unreality Sci-Fi Interview with Bennet ","summary":"Star Trek fans criticised previous relaunch books for their inconsistencies in tone, character, and direction.

This three-book, litverse crossover will shape the enter Star Trek shared continuity for years to come. David Mack has promised a truly epic, game-changer event with these books. This is a clash of civilizations: The Borg v The Federation. Who will win?\nSpoilers ahead!\nHistory David Mack was approached by Pocket Book editors Margaret Clarke and Marco Palmieri with a very specific request. Write a truly epic crossover trilogy. It had to be huge. It had to be an event. It had to be a statement piece.\nAfter pitching a few ideas, Mack was told \u0026ldquo;sorry, not epic enough.\u0026rdquo; Finally, he asked them what sort of books they had in the pipeline. At the time, since books a written a year or two in advance, they had a lot of Borg stories on the agenda. \u0026ldquo;Aha!\u0026rdquo; said David Mack, who then pitched, sold, and wrote the Destiny trilogy.\nIt is interesting to note that the previous books were not specifically leading up to Destiny. It was more that Destiny was written to fit around them! It goes to show there wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly a clear vision on where the post-Nemesis timeline would go. It was still, somewhat, in flux.\nMack was told to keep Voyager and Deep Space 9\u0026rsquo;s role in the books limited. This was because they had their independent post-TV stories going, and they wanted to ensure the Destiny books wouldn\u0026rsquo;t conflict.\nSince I read these books a little while ago, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to review all three at the same time, as my memories of the specific parts are a little hazy.\nStory A mysterious wreck is found by some of the Deep Space 9 crew, which turns out to be a long lost Federation ship. Fast forward 8 years and the Borg have launched their devastating attack in the Alpha quadrant. Captain Dax eventually figures out the wrecked ship is linked to the Borg incursion.\nRewind a century or two, and the early Starfleet vessel Columbia is going about its merry way, until some Romulans show up and, long story short, they kept captured by the Caeliar. These guys love their privacy, so leaving is a no go.\nEventually, Titan finds the Caeliar too, and they\u0026rsquo;re also captured. Except that a long time has passed and now former Columbia captain Erika Hernandez is now in possession of some seriously Jedi like powers. She helps the Titan crew escape. Meanwhile, Federation President Nan Bacco gets an intergalactic Borg fighting band together, and they march off to fight the Borg.\nFinally, the power Erika Hernandez poses as the Borg queen, in an attempt to liberate, rather than destroy the drones. We also find out, far into the past, the very first Borg is born\u0026hellip; a bitter, angry, sick and confused Caeliar assimilates its first victim.\nOpinion A lot of people say that the Destiny trilogy is a great jumping-on point for new Star Trek readers interested in the post-Nemesis literary timeline. Personally, I disagree.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, Destiny is some of the best Trek out there, at least in book form. But man it\u0026rsquo;s complicated. While it\u0026rsquo;s sold as a crossover series, when I first read it I thought it would be a crossover in the style of Star Trek: Generations; something akin to \u0026ldquo;Kirk and Picard team up to fight the bad guys\u0026rdquo;. But Destiny is a litverse crossover. That means a lot of new characters. A lot of details outlined in the preceding books.\n Mack holds the huge, twisty, timey-wimey story together will impressive skill  That aside, Destiny is just about everything it promised to be. The trilogy does not pull any punches. It was a gutsy move, exploring both the origin of the Borg and, in the end, defeating them for good. That\u0026rsquo;s right, we know how the Borg came about and we see the Borg threat neutralised once and for all.\nLike a lot of people, I found the Enterprise era story, featuring Hernandez, Inyx, and the MACOs, the most interesting. The story constantly shifts viewpoints, and some things that seem unrelated eventually come together. There were a few points where I found myself a little lost, or a bit impatient to get back to a more critical part of the story.\nBut Mack holds the huge, twisty, timey-wimey story together will impressive skill. And things come to a very satisfying conclusion in book 3. Mack also does a great job translating the feel of Star Trek from the screen to the page. Little, innocuous details help create a vivid sense of Trekkyness, without trying too hard.\nReception The Destiny trilogy received positive reviews online. All three books hold an \u0026ldquo;excellent\u0026rdquo; rating on TrekBBS. TrekLit described Gods Of Night as being, \u0026ldquo;[\u0026hellip;] an incredibly strong start to the Destiny trilogy.\u0026rdquo; While Trek Core said it was, \u0026ldquo;[\u0026hellip;] an excellent trilogy.\u0026rdquo; Trek Movie described the trilogy as achieving, \u0026ldquo;a startling transformation of the Star Trek universe.\u0026rdquo; While The Discriminating Fangirl described the trilogy as, \u0026ldquo;A masterpiece.\u0026rdquo; Needless to say the general reception was positive.\nMack said in an interview that the book did, and continues to, sell very well.\nThe Final Verdict The Destiny trilogy is big, bold, gutsy and well written. But best of all it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of fun. While I wish I had read a few more of the preceding books first, but I still enjoyed it.

William Leisner’s Losing The Peace is that kind of follow-up, giving the readers a moment to breathe after the epic events of Star Trek: Destiny.\nSpoilers ahead\nIf you were to stumble upon this book as a casual Star Trek fan, you’d find yourself quite confused. What, we liberated the entire Borg collective throughout the galaxy? Really? No, really? Well, yes, that really happened. And now we’re all in on the litverse. It’s obvious at this point that there will be no more self-contained Star Trek books.\nLosing The Peace offers some nuanced thoughts regarding what might happen in the aftermath of a huge war. We spend some time with a Risian, whose planet the Borg destroyed, while she was handing out cocktails on a cruise ship. Picard is just happy to the Borg voices in his head gone, while Geordi reconnects with his sister. Original litverse characters get their time as well. Choudhury struggles to align her deep spiritual beliefs with all the death and destruction, while Chen finds out her mother has breathed her last breath and her deadbeat dad is now back on the scene.\nThese scenes are pleasing, and help lay the new foundations. The new normal. This is the new Enterprise crew.\nBut the primary focus of the book is a refugee crisis on Crusher — a heavily pregnant Crusher — and the role she plays helping with the refugee crisis on the water planet Pacifica. Yes, that’s right folks, we rarely treat refugees very well. Queue the complaints: The book is preachy, is too SJW. Too woke. Better go make an hour-long video on YouTube ranting about it\u0026hellip;\nSome people, in online reviews, complained that the main story thread was preachy. Trek has always been a franchise that held its moral and ethical head high in the air. Voyager is thrust into a seven-year journey through the delta quadrant all because Janeway put the lives of an alien race ahead of herself and her crew. Picard refuses to unleash a deadly pathogen on the Borg because he didn’t believe it morally correct to wipe out a race using chemical warfare. So if you have a problem with this book, maybe Star Wars is more the sci-fi franchise for you.\nLeisner has a good grasp of character. It was nice spending some time exploring Crusher’s backstory; specifically her time after the death of her husband, but before joining Enterprise as the chief medical officer. I’ve always felt Crusher was an under-utilised character, so it’s nice to see her front and centre in the story.\nWe also say goodbye to Kadohata in this book. She was always a bit of a blah character to me, and I don’t think anyone cried too many tears when Leisner wrote her out of the series. They’ve now replaced most of the original characters introduced early in the relaunch with better characters such as Chen.\nThe book ends with Picard being offered a promotion to Admiral. He declines, quoting what Kirk said to him in Generations. To paraphrase; Don’t let them promote you. Stay a captain.\nI can’t say I loved the plot point in which Picard, yet again, disobeys Starfleet command and takes matters into his own hands. I think that’s has happened in nearly every recent TNG book. Is this behaviour consistent with such a died-in-the-wool Starfleet guy? Yes, Picard learns to loosen up during the show. But I don’t remember him resorting to so much insubordination just to satisfy his own whims.\nThere were also a few shakily written scenes. On two separate occasions, Leisner described a character as “staring daggers” at someone. Ugh. If I were a Simon \u0026amp; Schuster / Pocket Books editor, I would not let such lazy cliches sneak into a manuscript.\nOverall, Losing The Peace was a welcome change of pace. It was nice to read a story where a planet or civilisation was not about to be blown up by the Borg. Instead, Leisner brings things down to a smaller, more human level. It wasn’t a perfect book, and it might be a bit slow for some, but I found it a pleasant read and I hope to see more from Leisner in the future.\n","summary":"On Star Trek: The Next Generation, when Picard became Locutus and helped slay thousands at Wolf 359, that double episode was followed up with the episode Family, in which he travels to France to spend some time with his brother, of whom he does not get along with.

Poor President Bacco has developed a 24 hour migraine as she tries to patch the Federation back together. Who does she call? Why, none other than Earth’s resident problem solver and people persuader, Sonek Pran. The only battles in this book will be diplomatic ones. Star Trek: A Singular Destiny by Keith R.A. DeCandido offers a thoughtful epilogue to Destiny and also sets up some future storylines.\nIt was a rather dreadful week for the Federation, with over sixty billion of its citizens turned to dust. The war with the Borg made Wolf 359 look like a game of cops and robbers. A Singular Destiny includes several stories that intertwine but appear to be separate at first. There is an explosion at an important mining site. The Klingons lose a planet of little strategic value. And the Romulans will no longer accept the Federation’s leftovers.\nMr DeCandido excels at a certain type of storytelling that I think of as A simple story, well executed. This book, however, tries to weave a more complex story. It worked mostly, but at times it felt a bit bogged down. Nearly all the characters are original, so there is no giddy thrill of seeing Picard or Janeway on the page.\nThe brief excerpts and communiques throughout the book showing different people struggling with the aftermath of the war are interesting, even if they felt a bit like filler. Like his previous Trek book, Q\u0026amp;A, DeCandido likes to use different, one-shot characters to offer different viewpoints on a single thing. In Q\u0026amp;A, it was the cosmic tear in spacetime. In this book, it is the aftermath of the war.\n Nearly all the characters are original, so there is no giddy thrill of seeing Picard or Janeway on the page.  Somehow, the prose of A Singular Destiny didn’t feel as tight as his other works. It would often tell the reader what had happened, and explain things, rather than showing the reader using real-time, concrete scenes. Take this excerpt, for example:\n “Altoss was waiting only semi-patiently. Sonek didn’t need any particular skills in reading body language to see that the Efrosian ensign was ready to jump out of her skin”\n This passage tells us how Altoss is acting. It doesn’t show us. We could rewrite it:\n Altoss shifted her body weight, her eyes darting around the room. The Efrosian ensign glanced down at her phaser, her hand curling into a fist.\n This kind of immediate, action-based writing is a lot more dynamic and engaging.\nThat said, DeCandido is still an excellent writer. He brings his trademark relaxed, fun style to the story, even when it deals with heavy themes. It explores the tragic side of life without feeling overly sentimental or saccharine. My one gripe was Pran’s reaction to the death of his wife. It was a story element that felt shoehorned in, and I didn’t really buy his grief. I might have made it so she had already died at the beginning of the book, and he was still struggling with the pain of it.\nI can’t say I’ve ever felt much love for exploring the intricacies of Romulan politics — a subject that bogged down some of the early relaunch titles. In A Singular Destiny, however, I found Sonek’s meeting with Donatra to be one of the most enjoyable aspects. Sonek, as Federation diplomat, tries to broker a piece between Donatra and her Romulan counterpart Tal’Aura. He tries and fails. But it’s interesting to see how it all plays out.\nThe book offers a direct lead-in to the upcoming Typhon Pact series. It does an excellent job of naturally building a prelude event without telegraphing it, or tacking it on because the editor said so. That being said, it’s super weird that DeCandido himself did not write any of the Typhon Pact novels.\nIt was also a lot of fun to catch up with Ezri Dax and her crew aboard the U.S.S. Aventine. Although I didn’t totally buy the whole Bowers v Pran thing, I enjoyed the scenes where he was onboard, joining in on the jam sessions and stirring up trouble. I think it would have been great for the U.S.S. Aventine to get its own book series. I know they will show up here and there in future books, but I don’t think we will get to see them in much detail.\nMy impression of Keith R.A. DeCandido is that he is an outgoing guy who loves to talk. He stated in an interview that he wanted to give Sonek Pran the “superpower” of being able to speak to people. He certainly does, er, speak to many people.\nApart from being a prelude to Typhon Pact, the book also acts as a pseudo-sequel to Articles Of The Federation (also by DeCandido). It’s very much in the same vein, exploring the inner-workings of Federation politics. I think I probably liked this one more than Articles Of The Federation, but less so than his excellent Q\u0026amp;A.\nOverall, A Singular Destiny is another solid read from DeCandido, and it has made me excited to get to the Typhon Pact series. Good on ya’ KRAD, keep up the good work.\n","summary":"The Federation must deal with the fallout from the explosive events of Star Trek: Destiny.

And I hate to say it, but Bennet is my least favourite Trek writer.\nOver A Torrent Sea, published in 2009 and the fifth Titan spinoff, is the perfect example of why Bennet and I don\u0026rsquo;t gel. But firstly, let me list some of the things I like about Bennet. He has an imagination bigger than a member of the Q continuum, a solid grasp of character, and he\u0026rsquo;s dedicated to Trek lore — often choosing to plug small gaps in Trek canon with well-considered Easter-eggy details.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s not to like then? You see, Bennet commits the cardinal sin of genre fiction. His books are boring. They are books that sit on my nightstand, haunting me, the bookmark permanently stuck halfway through. Except for his decent Trek novel Greater Than The Sum, I\u0026rsquo;ve found all of his Trek books so far to be boring. But Over A Torrent Sea was the boringest of them all. It reads somewhere between a marine biology textbook and a fanfiction epic posted on Archive Of Our Own.\nSigh. Look, it\u0026rsquo;s not in my nature to criticise the author, even if I do criticise the work. But time and again, Bennet takes a fantastic idea and fumbles on the follow-through. The frustrating part is that the concept behind the book is awesome. In brief: The Titan crew stumble on a planet where sentient life exists solely underwater, so their technology is biology-based. Since warp drive and such things are pretty hard to construct out of seaweed and starfish, they fall under the prime directive as insufficiently advanced for contact. But when a nasty asteroid, laced with Titan based impurities is heading their way, the crew of Titan choose to step in.\nEven just writing that out, I am reminded that the book was teeming with potential. However, in practice\u0026hellip; Let me provide an excerpt to illustrate my point.\n “The interface between the upper ocean and the hypersaline layer was not a sharp divide. The two layers had separate convection currents, keeping them from mixing too extensively, but there was a gradual transition from one to the other, more like the distinction between two layers of an atmosphere or a stellar interior than between two strata of rock, say. Nonetheless, the pod was slowing as the water around it grew denser and more buoyant, and once it was confident it had become sufficiently immersed in the dynamo layer, Cethente set the antigravs to give the pod neutral buoyancy, halting its descent. The Syrath set the sensors to maximum gain, and opened its own senses as well—the same senses that had allowed its species to develop an advanced knowledge of astrophysics while living on a perpetually clouded world.”\n This is the kind of writing I\u0026rsquo;ve seen referred to as \u0026ldquo;hyper-detailed\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s usually based on the (correct) belief that specific, concrete details from the narrator help create an authentic, vivid reading experience. However, to create this authentic/vivid/concrete fictive reality, the writing must also be concise. The above passage? Concise it is not.\nI know that in the future humanity is super smart. Quantum physics is a standard high school subject. Warp theory gets taught at the academy. But I found it hard to believe that everyone on Titan was instantly an expert on marine biology. Perhaps it could have been better to have one character be the expert, and then they explain it to the others. This could have helped avoid the massive infodumps and grounded the narrative in more scenes.\n Hell, I'd rather get operated on by Reginald Barclay.  And then there is the story itself. We get to see Riker — starving, dehydrated and delirious — laying about in a loincloth and unable to help the mission. To some extent, a media franchise needs to challenge the fans, but also give the fans a little of what they want. Do Trek fans want to see Riker reduced to such a pathetic and helpless victim?\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s nothing compared to what happens with Ree and Troi. The good dino doctor kidnaps Deanna and forces her to give birth on another planet, which is also pre-Warp and pretty terrified when a dinosaur rocks up and takes over their hospital\u0026rsquo;s maternity ward. What? Ree, who is probably the most likeable of the original Titan characters, acts so stupidly that I might never take him seriously again. A doctor who kidnaps his patients when they\u0026rsquo;re pregnant. Think about it. I\u0026rsquo;d rather get operated on by Tom Paris. Hell, I\u0026rsquo;d rather get operated on by Reginald Barclay.\nMost of us Trekkies approach the books with a fairly forgiving, easy-going attitude. We don\u0026rsquo;t expect them to be exceptional novels. We just want Picard to say \u0026ldquo;engage\u0026rdquo;, Janeway to drink her coffee black and Spock to raise a single eyebrow. Give us a bit of what we know and love, and mix that in with the big, wacky ideas. It can be a tough task to translate the magic of Trek to the humble page of the written novel. As I said, a Trek book doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be exceptional — but please don\u0026rsquo;t make it boring.\nSorry folks, but I have to give Over A Torrent Sea the same score as the disastrous Before Dishonor. Good ideas are let down by lousy execution. It\u0026rsquo;s nothing personal Mr Bennet.\n","summary":"Christopher L Bennet and I got beef.

Apart from tying up the loose ends from the preceding novels, she also had to: 1) Deal with \u0026ldquo;the Janeway thing\u0026rdquo; from Before Dishonor 2) Launch the Full Circle Fleet storyline 3) Work it all in with the aftermath of Star Trek: Destiny\nOnce more unto the Delta Quadrant, dear friends\u0026hellip;\nSpoilers ahead\nVoyager (the show) remains a sentimental favourite for me. But the relaunch novels didn\u0026rsquo;t quite know what to do with the intrepid crew once they were back on terra firma. So when I read that Beyer\u0026rsquo;s books would send them back to the Delta Quadrant, I thought it was a clever idea, bordering on genius. It was the thing that defined Voyager from other Trek iterations, and it just made sense to re-explore the region. It was a clever twist.\nFull Circle’s first half is mainly spent tying up the Miral/Kuvah\u0026rsquo;magh story, which I always found a bit blah. But Beyer cleverly ties this story thread in with the Full Circle Fleet, as B\u0026rsquo;Elanna plans to end the game of hide-and-seek she\u0026rsquo;s playing with the warriors of Gre\u0026rsquo;thor by finding the best hidey-hole in the galaxy — which happens to cross paths with Voyager\u0026rsquo;s new course.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s in the second half that the book really gets its warp engines revving. Admiral Batiste cooks up the crazy plan to send Voyager back to the very place they found themselves oh so lost in, but Janeway says something akin to: Over my dead body. Well\u0026hellip; since part 2 fast-forwards to post-Destiny, poor old Janeway has danced off into the darkness with Lady Q.\n It's in the second half that the book really gets its warp engines revving.  As the story progressed, I thought we would see Janeway beamed down in a ray of Q-infused light — she\u0026rsquo;d scoop up Seven and Chakotay and bam — Admiral Janeway commands the fleet while Captain Chakotay sits in Voyager\u0026rsquo;s big chair. By the time the last few chapters came about, the state of play became obvious, with O.G. characters Batiste in command of the fleet and Eden as the captain of Voyager. Personally, I would have ended the novel with Chakotay and Janeway in those spots. Still, since I haven\u0026rsquo;t read any of the preceding novels since A Farther Shore, in the context of the other books it might have been too rushed to bring them back so soon.\nThen there is the quality of Beyer\u0026rsquo;s prose. At first, I struggled with it. I\u0026rsquo;ve criticised seasoned Trek writer Christopher L Bennet for telling/explaining too much to the reader. Well, Beyer is just about the telliest, explainiest writer I\u0026rsquo;ve come across. The number of times she literally tells the reader how a character feels is astounding. She breaks the most basic rules of \u0026ldquo;good writing\u0026rdquo; again and again.\nHowever, her writing does carry a certain weight and punch. Once I shut down my analytical brain and just read the book, I found myself reading chapter after chapter until well past my bedtime. Not since the Destiny trilogy did I find myself so compelled to keep flipping the pages.\nLet’s read a short excerpt from the book:\n “Tuvok felt no fear as she said this. He did, however, realize that if he did not find a way to defend himself against her assault, he would probably not last the afternoon, let alone as long as she intended.”\n Beyer has forced me to rethink my idea of good prose. While the above may not win any literary prizes, it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of writing that fails the intellectual \u0026ldquo;is it good\u0026rdquo; test but passes the \u0026ldquo;is it fun to read\u0026rdquo; test. Which, I suppose, is the most important test. But what if I rewrote it, to be more punchy and descriptive?\n Tuvok stood straight and lifted his chin. As he looked about the room, he noted only soft furnishing and curious knick-knacks; nothing that could heft some weight should push come to shove. A sly grin curled her lips.\n What do you think? Which one is better?\nPerhaps the main reason Beyer succeeds is that when she does show, she shows us well-constructed scenes that give the characters internal conflicts to work through. The flashbacks in which Chakotay (normally a pleasant, but boring character) struggles with Janeway\u0026rsquo;s death are a wonderful example of character-driven scenes with real emotional weight. She pushes Chakotay to the edge and even lets him fall, at least just a little.\nAnother criticism I\u0026rsquo;ve had of other Trek novels is they often spend too much time with original characters who, interesting as they may be, aren\u0026rsquo;t the reason many of us pick up a Trek book. Libby, for example, was a character I liked, but she took over A Farther Shore — and it was annoying spending so much time with her and not her love interest Harry Kim! In Full Circle, however, Eden and Batiste are important to the story but we still spend plenty of time with Tom, B\u0026rsquo;Elanna, Chakotay and Seven.\nKirsten Beyer really hit a home run with Full Circle. She managed to work Voyager into the post-Nemesis, post-Destiny timeline with grace and style. It was one of the few Trek books that really kept me wanting more and I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to read the follow-up Unworthy. Yes, her prose is sometimes a little amateurish, but she also proves you don\u0026rsquo;t need beautiful writing to create an effective and engaging story.\n","summary":"When Kirsten Beyer picked up the heavy gauntlet of the Voyager relaunch titles, she sure faced a challenge.

Namely, putting the Voyager crew back into their original seats\u0026hellip; more or less. With Full Circle, author Kirsten Beyer sent the U.S.S. Starship Voyager hurtling back to the Delta Quadrant, thanks to some mean and lean slipstream technology. But the crew were still fractured, physically and emotionally — what will it take to bring Starfleet\u0026rsquo;s finest back to the adventure?\nKirsten Beyer won a lot of hearts and minds with her previous Voyager novel, Full Circle. It reigned in the chaos of the previous books and began putting the pieces of the playset back into their rightful configuration. But she didn\u0026rsquo;t rush it. I honestly thought by the end of Full Circle, we\u0026rsquo;d have seen B\u0026rsquo;Elanna, Tom, Chakotay, Seven — and even Admiral Janeway — back manning the consoles of Voyager\u0026rsquo;s bridge.\nIt became apparent that Beyer isn\u0026rsquo;t one to rush things. For the most part, this is probably good, as rushing things would only feel predictable and unearned. Instead, Unworthy marches to the beat of its own Ressikan flute, er, so to speak. B\u0026rsquo;Elanna finally manages to shake off her chasers and even catches up with our favourite Talaxian chef, Neelix. Tom is forgiven by Eden for his deception, and Chakotay sneaks his way on board to help out poor Seven — who forgot to write her name on her underwear, so the Caelian Gestalt implanted a voice in her head to help her remember that her name is Annika Hansen.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s talk about the new characters. Eden and Batiste strike me as being Janeway and Chakotay in reverse. Eden is dark-skinned, even-tempered and of a lower rank. Batiste is impulsive, adventurous and commands the fleet with zeal. Okay, it\u0026rsquo;s not a perfect comparison, but I do wonder if this is how the characters formed in Beyer\u0026rsquo;s imagination.\nThe new counsellor, Hugh Cambridge, is an interesting character — but I can never quite buy into his abrasive style. It feels a bit forced at times. The other newer characters include Nancy Conlon, who buddies up with B\u0026rsquo;Elanna in engineering, Aytar Gwyn, whose hair is blue and don\u0026rsquo;t you forget it, Doctor Sharak, who is just kind of there, and Kenth Lasren who is also, well, there. And of course, the TNG favourite Reg Barclay is a welcome addition to the cast — and Beyer writes him superbly.\nOne nice aspect of Voyager\u0026rsquo;s TV run was watching Naomi Wildman grow up. I always wished we\u0026rsquo;d seen a little more of the relationship between Naomi, her mother, and Neelix. Now we have Miral (Tom and B\u0026rsquo;Elanna\u0026rsquo;s daughter), who might give us that same sense of continuity. I giggled every time she\u0026rsquo;d say \u0026ldquo;p\u0026rsquo;tak!\u0026rdquo; (a Klingon slur) amongst otherwise polite company.\nSpeaking of Neelix, we only get to see him briefly when he helps out B\u0026rsquo;Elanna. However, I have a feeling he\u0026rsquo;s going to show up in the next book. But Captain Janeway is barely even mentioned. I know she\u0026rsquo;s coming back, but just when and how I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Perhaps it will coincide with Eden finding her home planet out there in the deep dark depths of the Delta Quadrant.\n Beyer's writing is still equal parts wonderful and infuriating.  The actual story itself is a little more monster-of-the-week, in which we meet in the Indign. They\u0026rsquo;re a Borg worshipping co-op, who occasionally scoop up a room full of dead people and offer them to their favourite cybernetically enhanced galaxy-conquering collective. At first, I groaned: Oh no, it\u0026rsquo;s a Borg story! It\u0026rsquo;s not that I dislike the Borg, it\u0026rsquo;s just that I\u0026rsquo;ve had my fill of them. Thankfully, the story keeps the Borg on the periphery.\nBeyer\u0026rsquo;s writing is still equal parts wonderful and infuriating. She explains every feeling a character has and lets adverbs fly wildly around bloated sentences. But, once the final chapter closes, I can\u0026rsquo;t deny she takes the reader on a mighty fun ride. Reading this book, I found myself analysing the writing less and getting into the groove of the story more.\nI have two minor quibbles with the plot. Firstly, the Seven of Nine aspect felt half-baked. I thought the voice in her head would have a real, concrete impact on the story. However, by the end, it fizzles out when she confronts it. And her Caeliar catoms don\u0026rsquo;t amount to much either.\nSecondly, the \u0026ldquo;Megan\u0026rdquo; subplot felt a bit tacked on. Apparently, Reg and Doctor Z cooked up a perfect holographic housewife for the Doctor, but the Doctor believes her to be a regular eating/sleeping/breathing/peeing human. But right when things are starting to go bow-wow-chikka-bow-wow, she\u0026rsquo;s possessed by one of the Children Of The Storm. Queue the sequel novel.\nThat being said, the above are pretty nitpicky points, and neither did much to tarnish my enjoyment of the novel.\nOne aspect I did enjoy was the revisit into our galaxy from species 8472, particularly the scene in which Chakotay transports onto the bridge and has friendly chitchat with his old 8472 flame. Beyer really excels at constructing these sorts of scenes, which are both a fun callback to the show and an entertaining way to move the story forward.\nOverall, Unworthy was a very worthy sequel to the equally excellent Full Circle. I\u0026rsquo;ll be rounding out this mini-run of Voyager novels by reading Children Of The Storm next, before returning to the Titan series with James Swallow\u0026rsquo;s Synthesis.\n","summary":"There is something to be said for getting back to the status quo.

Riker and the diverse crew of the U.S.S. Titan are back, this time in the hands of British author James Swallow. Following on from the lackluster Over A Torrent Sea (by Christopher L Bennet), I was hoping that Mr. Swallow could inject some fun and action into this spinoff book series. Did he succeed?\nSpoilers ahead\nThe book begins with Malora Pazlar discovering an intriguing set of subspace distortions. Meanwhile, Riker is trying to take a hard-earned holo-holiday with his wife, Deanna Tori, and daughter, Natasha. He bumps into the reptilian Dr. Ree, who is a little bashful after he, y’know, kidnapped the captain’s wife and all that business (see Over A Torrent Sea).\nThe next scene, in which Riker has awkward chitchat with Holor Sethe, is the first clue that James Swallow has an excellent grasp of Titan’s characters. I don’t remember Sethe from any of the previous Titan books (he may be a Mr. Swallow original) but the amusing scene in which Riker, dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and swim shorts, impatiently waits to use the holodeck while Sethe is performing some unnecessary maintenance — was fun, funny, and also set up the story to come.\n It was nice to see Tuvok doing something other than announcing things from the tactical station  The character work continues with Tuvok, Pava, Modan, Torvig enjoying a friendly Bajoran card game (at least I think that’s what it was — well, some kind of card game anyway). It was nice to see Tuvok doing something other than announcing things from the tactical station. In the next couple of chapters, the young Cardassian Zurin Dakal and the Pak\u0026rsquo;shree K\u0026rsquo;chak\u0026rsquo;!\u0026lsquo;op are introduced with equal success. (Luckily, the book uses the abbreviated Chaka instead of K\u0026rsquo;chak\u0026rsquo;!\u0026lsquo;op, so I don’t have to keep mentally trying to pronounce that name every time it comes along on the page).\nStorywise, things kick into gear when the crew investigates some wreckage, only to find that the wreckage is the remains of a sentient AI machine. It wakes up, feeling a bit confused and sorry for itself, and finds its way into the Titan\u0026rsquo;s computer system. While it’s in there, it buddies up with Titan’s impressive app store and software collection, and decides to “uplift” the Titan’s computer so the ship itself manifests as a holographic, sentient being.\nThe alien Sentry known as White-Blue turns out to be a very different kind of AI to, say, Data (an inevitable comparison to make, I know). White-Blue is passionate, flawed, untrusting, and a bit temperamental. But through the story, it learns to understand Titan’s ways, and eventually helps them.\nMeanwhile, the bad guy reveals itself — the thing responsible for White-Blue’s initial troubles is revealed as The Null. Small aside: I do wonder if James Swallow ever worked in software or web development, as he skilfully uses a lot of programming terminology in the book, such as “null” — which basically means “nothing.” Anyway, The Null is a hungry, cancerous type of protomatter that has been breaking into this region of space, and its favorite food just happens to be on our side of the inter-dimensional divide.\nThe character work in this book continues to shine as Torvig and the now sentient Titan Avatar (as I will now call it) become fast friends. Torvig’s species, who are enhanced with all kinds of crazy cybernetics, were uplifted into self-awareness much in the same way the Titan Avatar was. It turns to Torvig for guidance, support, and even advice. This is the first Titan book so far that has made me connect with Torvig. In the previous iterations, I found him a little annoying. But in this book, we see more of his sweet and naive side. The scenes where he and the Titan Avatar interact are some of my favorites in the book.\nThe Sentries (the AI machines) eventually have had enough of Titan and ask the crew to be on their merry way, so that they can focus on fighting The Null. But things get complicated when Tuvok and co get stranded on a moon-sized exiled computer mind, Zero-Three. Another Sentry, Red-Gold, thinks Titan could help them out in the battle and decides to take control by force, rather than being polite and just asking. AI robots just have no manners these days.\nProbably my favorite part of the story is when the Titan Avatar is asked to (temporarily) shut itself down, and must trust Riker and the crew to wake it up again once the battle is over. It was a great moment, in which it learns to believe in Riker and his crew, and it also demonstrates how the crew’s attitude towards its latest crew member evolved from distrust to complete acceptance.\nThe actual ending itself is okay — I did feel the part where the Titan Avatar sacrifices itself by sending its matrix or whatever into The Null was a bit hammy and half-baked. To be honest, I don’t even really quite understand what it did — like, did it reprogram the subspace protomatter somehow? And how could a computer program do that? I realize that things had to reset a bit after the story ended, so why not simply have the Titan Avatar join the Sentries to help them grow, now that they no longer have The Null to worry about? Yes, it would have been a bit predictable, but that’s not always a bad thing when it works with the story.\nI can’t say I love every character on Titan just yet. Although I must say this book did an excellent job with the characters in general, particularly Torvig. Ranul Keru is a bit whiny, and Ra-Havreii just somehow never quite clicked with me. There were some good Tuvok scenes, but I still feel he is an under-appreciated and under-used character. On a more positive note, I enjoyed a couple of nice moments in which Troi takes command of the bridge — I’d love to see a book where Troi goes into kick-ass commander mode, a bit like Janeway did in a couple of Voyager episodes.\nGenerally, the book received positive (if slightly mixed) reviews online. It holds a “Very good” rating on Trek BBS. TrekLit gave it a mediocre 6/10, which I felt was a bit harsh. Having read a few other online reviews, there were two common criticisms. One was that the stakes were too high (seeing as The Null could destroy the entire galaxy). Treklit readers, at this point, are obviously a bit fatigued with constant, galaxy-ending events in the books. That being said, Synthesis didn’t lean heavily on this — it was almost an afterthought. The other criticism was things wrapped up a bit too neatly, which I suppose I agree with, but it wasn’t a major detractor for me.\nAs it stands, Star Trek: Titan: Synthesis by James Swallow is pretty much everything I want in a Titan/Star Trek novel. It’s fun and we get some good character moments. It balances thoughtful themes, with some solid action — and a healthy scattering of lighthearted moments too. I have high praise for Mr. Swallow’s character work; yes, it did probably benefit from the fact that five books in, I’m generally more familiar with the characters, so there is no confusion over who’s who in the Titan zoo. Synthesis is my equal favorite Titan novel thus far (alongside The Red King).\nSince the excellent Literary Treks (podcast) haven’t reviewed this one, you may like to check out The Captain’s Table podcast.

Children Of The Storm takes place concurrently with the previous novel, Unworthy. Can Beyer score a hat-trick with book #3?\nSpoilers ahead\nThe titular “Children of the Storm” were first mentioned in David Mack’s Destiny trilogy. I don’t remember them, but apparently, they didn’t feature as much more than a throwaway line or two. Something about them caught Ms Beyer’s eye, and thus she decided to expand the idea into a full-blown novel.\nThe book starts when Voyager is busy breaking bread with the Indign (see Unworthy), and so the focus is on the other Full Circle Fleet ships; Planck, Demeter, and Quirinal. They’re on the way to check out these “Children of the Storm” since they are pretty powerful and the Federation would prefer them as allies rather than, well, neutral peoples I guess.\nAnyway, some folks onboard one of the ships get hungry, but the other ship has all the food. The foodie dreamboat Demeter goes to warp when it shouldn’t, and the Children aren’t too happy about it. Things really go pear-shaped when the Children destroy Planck.\nIn this book, we’re introduced to a lot of new characters. And I mean a lot. Quirinal’s captain, Regina Farkas, and most of her crew are pretty forgettable. However, the food/horticultural vessel Demeter’s crew are the ones that steal the show. The odd-bod Captain Liam O\u0026rsquo;Donnell prefers a quiet night in with his genetically engineered plants, while he chats with his deceased missus. Conversely, his “number 1” Atlee Fife is pretty much left in charge of running the ship.\nIt turns out the Children are nuts for the plants growing on Demeter, and so the crew work around the clock to keep the green things alive and growing. However, Fife grows impatient with the endless stalling and figures it would be better to cut-n-run — if only that were possible. The Children are so powerful they can hold a starship suspended in space.\nEventually, Voyager catches up with Quirinal, the latter having captured a few stray Children. They managed to figure out some communication, and Eden figures these Children have been a bit naughty so they’d best go find their mother.\nFinally, the eccentric Captain O’Donnell engineers a plant that can survive on the Children’s homeworld, but Fife has decided if they’re going to go down, they’re going down swinging. A battle ensues, but Voyager manages to step in before too much damage is done.\nChildren Of The Storm is an ambitious work, threading together multiple timelines, multiple viewpoints, and a large cast of characters. I wish I could say it all worked beautifully, but at times the story did lack direction. Clocking in at 400 pages, it’s a lengthy novel too. I tend to prefer Star Trek books that stick mostly with the characters I already know from the small screen. Of course, a new character or two is fine as long as the focus isn’t solely on them. In this book, however, Voyager\u0026rsquo;s crew are in the background.\n O’Donnell and Fife emerge as standout characters.  But there is plenty to like about the book too. As mentioned above, O’Donnell and Fife emerge as standout characters. It’s also a book that stretches your imagination; the Children exist as manifestations of pure thought, encased in polychromatic spheres. There are also many enjoyable B-plots, such as the tension between the engineers B’Elanna and Drafar.\nThe book also continues on the arc of Afsarah Eden searching for her homeworld, which she figures are somewhere in the Delta Quadrant. In the end, she confides in Chakotay that part of the reason she accepted this mission was to unlock the riddle of her mysterious origins. And since her husband turned out to be a member of Species 8472 (awkward!) I think just about anything is possible.\nCome to think of it, Children Of The Storm is positively riddled with subplots. On top of everything else, there is the burgeoning romance between Seven of Nine and Counselor Cambridge. While I don’t mind the concept of it, I didn’t think much of Cambridge fobbing off his patients while he pored over documents concerning Afsarah’s origins. Kind of negligent, if you ask me. And the other-other subplot, involving B’Elanna and the mysterious cache of Starfleet one-man fighter jets fell a bit flat.\nMs Beyer’s strength, I think, is really in her ability to get inside the characters heads, and make them overcome personal struggles. We care when they care. Children Of The Storm has plenty of nice character moments but the overall plot was a bit muddled.\nNeelix also makes a brief return, which I enjoyed, although I can’t work out if he will eventually rejoin the crew, as it’s obvious Ms Beyer isn’t into easy-win fan service. After all, we are now three books in and there is still no sign of Captain Janeway! I’d love to see them both rejoin the crew in the next instalment (and since Janeway is on the cover of the next book, I guess 1 / 2 of my wishes might come true).\nSpeaking of old cast rejoining the crew… maybe Kes? Yes, you heard me. Kes! I always liked the character, and a part of me is still hanging out for her return. Although of course, she should be brown-bread by now…\nA few quibbles aside, Star Trek: Voyager: Children Of The Storm is a fine book. In many ways Beyer is a victim of her success; having set the bar so high with her previous novels, the pressure was on to do it again. Perhaps the storyline was a bit too ambitious, and I didn’t find all the new characters appealing — although O’Donnell and Fife were great. Online reviews suggest the book was well-received, with many praising Beyer’s multi-book story arcs and elevation of Voyager’s sometimes droll characters.\nMy final verdict: Not quite as good as Full Circle or Unworthy — but still pretty good.\n","summary":"Following up from two popular and successful Voyager novels, author Kirsten Beyer is back with her third post-Destiny Voyager instalment.

In it, Julian Bashir teams up with his former love interest, Sarina Douglas, to infiltrate the Breen and destroy the stolen quantum slipstream prototype.\nSpoilers ahead!\nThe story builds upon a couple of Deep Space Nine episodes, namely S06E09 Statistical Probabilities and S07E05 Chrysalis. In the latter episode, Julian Bashir helps a woman named Sarina who, like him, was genetically enhanced as a child. She is a dead-eyed mute until Bashir works some medical magic and she awakens to the world. He falls in love with her, but gets a bit too hot and heavy a bit too quickly, and ultimately pushes her away.\nSarina is sweet and naive in the show, highly intelligent and intellectually curious. And now, in Zero Sum Game, she is a cold-hearted killer bitch, having drunk the Section 31 kool-aid — willing to deck the halls with dead bodies and emotionally manipulate Bashir into doing Section 31\u0026rsquo;s dirty work.\nPerhaps Sarina Douglas has appeared in other novels, and therefore, if one has read them, her very sudden character arc wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be quite so jarring. I know Mack wrote a Section 31 spinoff novel Abyss featuring Bashir as the main character. But personally, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t reconcile the characters from the show with those found in Zero Sum Game.\nI have previously said that the worst thing a genre writer can do is spin a boring story. Well, in tie-in fiction, I think the worst thing a writer can do is get the characters wrong. Many of my least favourite Star Trek books have been written quite well, except that certain characters don\u0026rsquo;t line up with their onscreen counterparts. Although I believe David Mack to be an immensely talented writer, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry to say that it did feel as though he was squishing a spy-thriller story from another franchise into a Star Trek shaped hole — and the characters of Bashir and Sarina didn\u0026rsquo;t feel right.\nZero Sum Game is relatively short, presumably intended to be a quick, fun read. There is plenty of action, plenty of quips — and for the first third or so of the book, I was having a great time. Mack did an excellent job expanding the details of Breen culture. It turns out they are many different races underneath their helmets and armour. They strike a kind of social equality through their anonymity. I thought it was pretty clever.\nThe story goes that Bashir is recruited as a spy to work alongside Sarina Douglas. The Breen have pinched the blueprints to Starfleet\u0026rsquo;s quantum slipstream drive. Bashir and Sarina\u0026rsquo;s mission is to infiltrate the Breen, destroy their slipstream prototype and purge any details on making more. Supporting them is Ezri Dax and the crew of the U.S.S. Aventine, who drop the pair off, then sits around waiting for a text message.\nPerhaps the point where the story started to lose me was when Nar, a Breen with a rebellious streak, finds them and decides to help them out. How convenient that a member of the Breen underground discovered them before anyone else did. She buys their cover stories, sets them up with sweet identities, and adds a hefty sum of cashola into their Breen bank accounts.\n There is plenty of action, plenty of quips — and for the first third or so of the book, I was having a great time  This part irked me. She can create identities and posit vast sums of cash into bank accounts… why isn\u0026rsquo;t Nar living on a Breen luxury island somewhere with her fake computer money and a royal rank? No one takes off their helmets, so no one would know. It all seemed very convenient. But instead of an island vacation, Nar ends up getting tortured to death. Do many of us pick up a Star Trek book in the hopes of a little casual torture? It wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything too graphic; it\u0026rsquo;s just that it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel all that Trekky to me.\nA few chapters later, Bashir is shooting off into outer space, clinging onto the wing of a starship. Think about it. The thing broke atmosphere and flew at impulse speeds, and somehow Bashir, with his amazing Breen armour, was able to hang on?\nThen we get to Bashir\u0026rsquo;s character. First, he\u0026rsquo;s going gaga over Sarina, even though she\u0026rsquo;s swatting Breen down like their buzzing flies. Then, a chapter or two later, he has no problem murdering half a dozen unarmed Breen personnel. Bashir is a frickin\u0026rsquo; doctor! Yes, he has some inner conflict with the body count, but it\u0026rsquo;s pretty gross to watch him be so easily manipulated into a ruthless killing machine.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to say if Zero Sum Game was meant to be a \u0026lsquo;proper\u0026rsquo; Deep Space Nine book or intended as a spinoff. Either way, we only spend time with two DS9 regulars, Ezri Dax and Julian Bashir. It certainly doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like a long lost T.V. episode, jotted down in book form.\nMaybe I\u0026rsquo;m being a bit harsh on it. There are plenty of thrills and spills, and as usual, Mack\u0026rsquo;s writing style is smooth and easy to read. Nice moments dot the story. I particularly liked it when the Breen engineer took off his helmet before the asteroid exploded and destroyed him and his precious prototype ship. Something about that image was quite stirring.\nDavid Mack isn\u0026rsquo;t afraid to inject a fair dose of quippy humour into his Star Trek books, which generally I enjoy. Maybe it got a bit much towards the end, with Dax (about to be rammed by a Breen ship) pushing her crew to do an impossible reverse warp jump in less time than it takes to heat a pizza pocket, all the while grinning and making jokes. But still, a little humour can add a lot of balance.\nOverall, for me, Zero Sum Game was a misstep from a very talented writer. I could appreciate the well-crafted action scenes, but a half-baked story and characters that felt inconsistent with the show ultimately made this one a bit of a letdown.\n","summary":"Hot off the heels of his wildly successful Star Trek: Destiny trilogy, David Mack kicks off the Typhon Pact series with Zero Sum Game.

Martin returns to Star Trek: Titan with Seize The Fire. The Gorn have joined the Typhon Pact, but they have a problem. Their warrior caste hatchery world has gone kablooey, and it\u0026rsquo;s nigh-impossible to find another suitable location. Lucky for them, they have a big ol\u0026rsquo; terraforming device lying about. But Riker isn\u0026rsquo;t so keen on the idea of them using it\u0026hellip;\nSpoilers ahead!\nThe Gorn have gotten their dirty hands claws manus on a terraforming device they call an \u0026rsquo;ecosculptor\u0026rsquo;, and it can turn a desolate rock into a lush green paradise. They need it to create a suitable home for their younglings, but the only planet they\u0026rsquo;ve found suitable for ecosculpting is already populated by a pre-warp race. Terraforming a planet has the unfortunate side-effect of wiping out all of the indigenous life: plant, mineral, vegetable or animal.\nMeanwhile, a group of washed-up Gorn warriors rebel and decide they\u0026rsquo;re going to destroy the ecosculptor and create a new breeding program for an even better warrior caste.\nEnter William T. Riker, captain of the U.S.S. Titan. He\u0026rsquo;s not in the business of letting innocent planets get turned into a Gorn Garden of Eden. But the people of the Gorn’s target planet — the Hranrarii — are pre-warp, so he can\u0026rsquo;t pop down and tell them what\u0026rsquo;s going on. Indeed, he is stuck between a rock and a hard place.\nAuthor Michael A. Martin is also the co-author of the first two Titan books and the co-creator of the entire series. So I was cautiously optimistic this could be a solid read. But alas, this book is far from solid.\nFirstly, it\u0026rsquo;s too long. Not because there are plenty of twists and turns, but because the book is annoyingly repetitive. Every chapter rehashes the current crisis, and the reader is reminded of just what\u0026rsquo;s at stake (the Hranrarii) and what the weapon can do (it can create life, but it\u0026rsquo;s a terrible weapon too! Oh, what to do, what to do\u0026hellip;) Over and over again, we\u0026rsquo;re constantly reminded of the predicament they\u0026rsquo;re in.\nThe second major issue is that the muddy soup of Gorn characters are nearly impossible to tell apart, mainly because their names are so similar. As far as Gorn characters go, we have Gog’resssh, Rreszsesrr, Sazssgrerrn, Z’shezhira, Zegrroz’rh, S’syrixx, S’alath\u0026hellip; okay, that last one is actually the name of a Gorn ship. Anyway, it\u0026rsquo;s nearly impossible to remember who is who, since their names may as well be Sue, Susan, Sue-Anne, Suzy and Suzane.\n(Or, if we want the names to be a little more alien: S\u0026rsquo;ue, Su\u0026rsquo;san, Sue\u0026rsquo;nne, Suz\u0026rsquo;y and Su\u0026rsquo;z\u0026rsquo;a\u0026rsquo;ne\u0026hellip; (apostrophes make everything sound alien)).\nFurthermore, the Gorn storylines are a dull distraction from the Titan based chapters. The pace grinds to a halt as, once more, S’syrixx or Z’shezhira or whoever agonise over the choices they face. The Gorn characters are one-dimensional, and it\u0026rsquo;s hard to sympathise with them. The reader is constantly reminded that the reptiloid Gorn find mammals (such as humans) repulsive. I suppose it\u0026rsquo;s meant to invert the idea that humans are repulsed by reptiles such as snakes — but honestly, I quite like snakes, lizards and turtles, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t quite buy the idea that the Gorn hate mammals to such a degree and so unilaterally.\nSpeaking of characters, many of the characters in Seize The Fire continually do dumb-ass things. For instance, Riker keeps on beaming over to an enemy ship, and Z’shezhira keeps planning to sabotage the evil plans of Gog’resssh, only to either lose her nerve or stuff it up.\nWeirdly, by the end of the book, suddenly we find out the \u0026rsquo;ecosculptor\u0026rsquo; is a sentient AI being of some kind and not just a bunch of circuits and alloys. I have no idea why this was introduced so late in the story. It was interesting enough but unnecessary. Tuvok mind-melds with it, so yeah, now Vulcans can mind-meld with AI computers. Go figure.\n ... the Gorn storylines are a dull distraction from the Titan based chapters  It\u0026rsquo;s not all bad, though. Michael A. Martin was obviously tasked with expanding the Gorn, who appeared in just one episode of Star Trek: The Original Series. He does a decent job, as we learn that the Gorn are split into castes, and their children are born and raised in carefully produced hatcheries.\nJames Swallow\u0026rsquo;s excellent Titan novel Synthesis did a much better job with Titan\u0026rsquo;s diverse cast of characters. Swallow showed us a lot more interaction between sets of characters, giving us a chance to get to know them a little better. But with Seize The Fire, most of the characters are reduced to a few quippy one-liners, followed by them lamenting the tricky situation they find themselves in.\nThe book\u0026rsquo;s opening chapter showed a lot of promise, and the overall story is not a bad one. The book just severely needed to be cut down and re-edited. At 120 000 words, it\u0026rsquo;s a longish book (by tie-in standards). It could have been 20k words shorter and still be a satisfying length. But somehow, the book felt both rushed and overly long.\nTwo books in, and the Typhon Pact series is off to a mediocre start. I probably enjoyed Seize The Fire about as much as the first Typhon Pact entry, Zero Sum Game — although they are very different books with very different problems.\nSeize The Fire was a mixed bag. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping the third entry, Rough Beasts of Empire by David R. George III will be better.\n","summary":"Author Michael A. Martin returns to Star Trek: Titan with Seize The Fire.

Rough Beasts of Empire was written by David R. George III back in 2011. It\u0026rsquo;s a book of two parts: the first focuses on Benjamin Sisko (from Deep Space Nine) in the post Destiny era, and the second focuses on Spock and his quest for the reunification of Vulcan and Romulus.\nMajor spoilers ahead for both this book and Deep Space Nine (the tv series)\nBefore I get into the details of this review, I\u0026rsquo;m going to get the obvious stuff out of the way first: the Benjamin Sisko storyline sucks, while the Spock storyline is pretty good. In other words, Rough Beasts of Empire is about 50% of a good book.\nOkay, now that I\u0026rsquo;ve got that out of the way — I will also point out that, despite this book being #3 in the Typhon Pact series, it is chronologically the first. So now it makes a lot of sense why people recommend reading this one before Typhon Pact #1 Zero Sum Game and Typhon Pact #2 Seize The Fire.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t read the other Deep Space Nine books set after the series finale, so coming into this novel, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what Benny Sisko had been up to all these years. Deep Space Nine ended with him becoming a pseudo-God, adopted by the Bajoran prophets. Now, he\u0026rsquo;s back in corporeal form and helping with the whole Borg invasion thing (see Star Trek: Destiny).\nBut, as other reviews have pointed out, the Sisko we see in Rough Beasts of Empire feels divorced from the character we came to know and love on the show. The Bajoran Prophets have stopped returning his texts and they\u0026rsquo;ve unfriended him on Facebook. And in the wake of the recent Borg destruction, he\u0026rsquo;s convinced himself that if he stays with his wife (Kassidy Yates) and daughter, he\u0026rsquo;s doomed to a life of misery (because that\u0026rsquo;s what the prophets said would happen in the show).\nI have stated in earlier reviews that one of my three golden rules of tie-in novels is that no character should behave incongruently with their onscreen counterpart. Unfortunately, the Sisko storyline is an epic fail when held up against this rule. After watching him struggle for seven seasons as a single father, he then abandons his wife and child to the same fate. And I won\u0026rsquo;t even get into the racial aspects of it either. Safe to say, I think Avery Brooks would never have dreamed Sisko could take such a huge step back.\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s not all bad. I found the Spock/Romulan storyline to be a pleasant surprise. Spock and his small group of comrades have been secretly running a movement to unify the Vulcan and Romulan people. For those who don\u0026rsquo;t know, Romulans and Vulcans share a common heritage but developed vastly different cultures. I\u0026rsquo;m not typically an enthusiast of Romulan stories — and although it was a bit slow to start with, I found myself spellbound by the Romulan plotting, backstabbing and intrigue.\nEssentially, Spock pitches the idea of decriminalising the reunification movement, suggesting that it would help encourage the unification of the fractured Romulan empire — Donatra controls one half while Tal\u0026rsquo;Aura controls the other. But ultimately, he is used by Tal\u0026rsquo;Aura, who takes control of the empire\u0026hellip; only to find herself slumped over and drooling on the floor. Because lurking in the background is the Tzenkethi, secretly running the show.\n Much of the time David R. George III writes beautifully. But he lacks restraint.  I didn\u0026rsquo;t love the final twist, as I felt that the Tzenkethi were able to pull the Romulan puppet strings a bit too easily. After all that juicy plotting and scheming by Tal\u0026rsquo;Aura and co, it all came to naught, and for me, it felt a little flat. Nevertheless, it was nice to see the post-Nemesis/Romulan plot continue from earlier relaunch books such as Death In Winter and Taking Wing.\nThe last thing worth mentioning is author David R. George III\u0026rsquo;s writing style. George Orwell once said:\n Never use a long word where a short one will do. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.\n It\u0026rsquo;s safe to say David R. George III does not subscribe to this school of writing. Firstly, he uses some pretty obscure words, particularly in the book\u0026rsquo;s first half. Here are a few examples:\n A surfeit of powerful emotions threatened to overwhelm him The grave expression on her young face presaged her answer The ancient manuscript—it antedated the city itself  Now, I might just be a bit of a dummy, but I had to look up what each of those words means — surfeit, presaged and antedated are not exactly words commonly used in everyday language. Furthermore, his prose is verbose. Very verbose. Often there would be a line of dialogue, followed by 2-3 paragraphs outlining that character\u0026rsquo;s inner thoughts and feelings before the next line of dialogue appears. Sometimes I wanted to scream, Just let the characters speak!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not that he can\u0026rsquo;t write. Far from it, much of the time David R. George III writes beautifully. But he lacks restraint. It feels at times that his goal is to impress the reader, rather than immerse the reader in the fictional world. If I want literary fiction, I\u0026rsquo;ll read David Foster Wallace. If I want fun escapist fiction, I\u0026rsquo;ll read Star Trek.\nOverall, Rough Beasts of Empire is probably the best of the three Typhon Pact books thus far, but not by much. It\u0026rsquo;s a shame the Sisko storyline was such a fail because the book\u0026rsquo;s other half is a damned decent read. Pocketbooks (the publisher) was in financial turmoil at the time, and the book had multiple editors due to staffing changes — so perhaps that caused some issues. Nevertheless, it\u0026rsquo;s a novel that shows tremendous potential, and while I didn\u0026rsquo;t love it, I am looking forward to reading more David R. George III.\n","summary":"The third book in the Typhon Pact series is here. Rough Beasts of Empire was written by David R. George III back in 2011.

Shadows Have Offended is author Cassandra Rose Clarke’s Trek debut and features a story involving art theft, strange diseases and Picard’s impatience with Lwaxana Troi.\nSpoilers ahead\nShadows Have Offended features two distinct storylines. Story A features Picard, Worf and Deanna Troi travelling to Betazed to attend a hoity-toity revealing of ancient artefacts brought together for the first time. Story B features Riker, Data and Crusher travelling to a planet which is set to become a new world for intergalactic refugees, but everyone and everything gets struck down by a mysterious illness.\nThe Betazed storyline is lighthearted and fun. Aside from the main story (which involves three priceless artifacts getting stolen), it also dives deeper into the Troi/Worf romance that bubbled up from nothing in season 7 of The Next Generation. On-screen, the romance fizzled out as quickly as it came and always felt to me like a weird twist that didn’t need to happen. So I suppose it was ripe for expansion, and it can be fun when a tie-in novel expands on unexplained details from the show.\n Cassandra Rose Clarke did a fine job with all the TNG regulars  The romance itself, in the novel, isn’t exactly a huge part of the story. We see Troi and Worf getting along well, flirting a little and supporting each other. Personally, I would have liked the book to have taken it a step further and dive into a complete, blossoming romance — perhaps even showing us the exact set of circumstances that led up to that on-screen kiss.\nThe Crusher focused storyline, in which a mystery illness infects both man and machine, was probably the stronger of the two. I’m a big Beverly Crusher fan, and I’ve enjoyed seeing her character become more fleshed out in the books (William Leisner’s very decent Losing the Peace comes to mind). Cassandra Rose Clarke did a great job with Crusher, and it was fun to see her science-the-shit out of the mystery illness.\nIn fact, Cassandra Rose Clarke did a fine job with all the TNG regulars — Deanna Troi, Data, Riker and Crusher were all written consistently with their TV personas. As I read the dialogue, I could hear the actor’s voices performing the lines. Lwaxana Troi was particularly strong in the book. The story showcased a trademark Lwaxana mini-arc. She starts overbearing but slowly settles into a helpful character with surprising depth. Picard was the only character that, for me, felt slightly off — I think because he seemed so unsure of himself when embroiled in the artefact theft investigation. It wasn’t that I minded Picard in the role of comic relief (it was fun to see him struggle with the indignity of the ceremony), but Picard was always cool under fire, so to see him flailing about didn’t feel quite right.\nMy main gripe is that the Crusher storyline felt a bit padded out. In the book’s second act, there were at least half a dozen chapters in which team Crusher found themselves the victim of a weird set of disruptions — replicators going berserk and Data vocalising strange sounds — but then it happened again, and again… and again. Considering the book is relatively short (about 70 000 words, while many Trek novels are about 90-100 000 words), I would have liked a stronger sense of progress. For me, it was pretty obvious there was some mysterious lifeform behind the chaos, and if it was obvious to me, it certainly should have been obvious to Starfleet personnel.\nOne more minor quibble: it might have been nice if the two storylines tied together somehow at the end. The book has a vague theme of, \u0026ldquo;learning to make do with what you have rather than relying on the things you think you need\u0026rdquo;. For example, Crusher must figure out the mystery illness without using her technology (since that’s “sick” as well), and Worf/Troi must use subterfuge and guile instead of strictly doing things the Starfleet way. In that sense, they are vaguely linked, but if they came together somehow, it could have taken the story to the next level.\nAll that being said, Shadows Have Offended was a fun, light read that kept me entertained and scratched my itch for 90s TV Trek. It felt like an extended episode, but in a good way. We live in strange times at the moment, so we all need some fun escapism now and then — and if that’s what you’re after, I highly recommend Shadows Have Offended.\n","summary":"It’s been a while since we’ve had a TV-era Star Trek: The Next Generation novel hit the shelves.

Ask a Trekkie what their favourite Trek show is, and they\u0026rsquo;ll probably either say The Original Series or The Next Generation. Fair enough, those two are the biggest and most well-known iterations. But there will usually be one person lurking in the dark shadows of the room who will say, \u0026ldquo;Deep Space Nine is the best.\u0026rdquo;\nAlthough Voyager and Enterprise certainly have their fans (I am a big Voyager fan), Deep Space Nine is often regarded as the unsung hero of Trek — a dark horse in the Trek canon. A bigger cast, more character development, a darker tone, and a semi-serialised storyline all add up to a different kind of viewing experience.\nAnd I have never been a fan.\nHowever, I have decided to give Benjamin Sisko and Co another go. Perhaps, like Voyager, I can learn to love DS9, warts and all.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t rehash the storyline other than to say the pilot sets up a lot of plot threads that will eventually unravel. Two things that tended to bug me about DS9 is that both Avery Brooks (as Ben Sisko) and Nana Visitor (as Major Kira) really overact. Like, it\u0026rsquo;s almost a Nic Cage level of over-acting. But this time, I tried to look past it.\nReligion and spirituality are a big part of DS9, and this was never something I particularly warmed to. I won\u0026rsquo;t harp on about my thoughts on religion and spirituality, other than to say it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to believe that any civilisation capable of faster-than-light travel would be stuck in the quagmire of religious ambiguity. I refer to the planet Bajor, who worships a bunch of crystals in jars — but they have been through a brutal 60-year occupation by the Cardassians (AKA the bad guys) and therefore finding solace and unity in religion maybe isn\u0026rsquo;t such a crazy notion.\nJean-Luc Picard makes a guest appearance and, well, it\u0026rsquo;s not exactly a highlight. It would seem that when Picard temporarily became Locutus of Borg, he inadvertently killed Sisko\u0026rsquo;s wife, Jennifer. Sisko is standoff-ish (to say the least), but they part with a handshake by the end of the episode. Sisko has learned that, to some extent, he must let go of his grief and move on.\nAnother aspect of DS9 I never liked was the Quark v Odo frenemies thing. To be honest, I never particularly liked either character, much less cared for the many scenes in which one character tries to get one up on the other. However, this time, I\u0026rsquo;m prepared to be a bit more easy-going on them and remember it\u0026rsquo;s just a show, and I should watch it for fun.\nDespite some clunky moments (E.g.

A mass extinction event is cruising through space, and its name is Hamner/Brown. When the apocalypse arrives, how will humanity deal with the fallout? Water vaporised, endless salt-water rain, earthquakes\u0026hellip;\nHide your kids, hide your wife. The comet is coming.\nSpoilers ahead!\nLucifer\u0026rsquo;s Hammer is a classic work of science fiction and was nominated for the Hugo and Locus awards for Best Novel. The dynamic writing duo of Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven published it in 1977, and along with their similar end-of-the-world novel Footfall, set the benchmark for end-of-the-world stories. A vast cast of characters, unconnected at first, are brought together by the comet and the havoc it wreaks.\nThe story starts with Richie Rich amateur astronomer Tim Hamner discovering a comet — but don\u0026rsquo;t worry, the chances of it hitting earth are like a million to one. No, wait, a thousand to one. No, wait\u0026hellip; The first act goes on to introduce a dizzying array of characters. The main members of the cast are Tim Hamner (see above), documentary filmmaker Harvey Randall, and United States senator Arthur Jellison. The early pages are littered with soap opera moments that don\u0026rsquo;t equate to much — Barry Price is sleeping with his secretary, for example, never really has much meaning or consequence. These soap opera moments are similar to the ones found in Footfall. Their purpose, I assume, is to add a little spice to the long opening setup.\nSpeaking of the similarities to Footfall, Mark Czescu is very similar to Footfall\u0026rsquo;s Hairy Red. Both are bikers, not winning at life, who sing for their supper. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit weird that two similar characters would feature in two similar books.\nBut then the comet strikes, and the book kicks into high gear. The Hammer, as the comet is known, spares no one — and only those able to scramble to higher ground survive the tsunamis and other destruction. Shortly after it hits, we witness China and Russia enter a game of \u0026ldquo;who can nuke who first\u0026rdquo;. Things aren\u0026rsquo;t looking too good.\nThe book is interspersed with poet snippets that describe the great destruction of The Hammer, but for the most part, the story is set in California. Nearly every character introduced early on has a critical role in the latter stages of the book — unlike Footfall, which often introduced characters that faded out of the story.\nThe book\u0026rsquo;s final third focuses on a small township attempting to survive the aftermath. Our heroes face tough ethical choices — and eventually decide to set up barricades to keep desperate \u0026ldquo;refugees\u0026rdquo; out of their town. Food is scarce, as the characters ultimately agree they can \u0026ldquo;only be as ethical as they can afford to be\u0026rdquo;. This is a bit different from the more liberal Hollywood disaster stories, in which there is usually an impassioned speech declaring that we must help everyone wherever possible, despite the dire situation at hand. Lucifer\u0026rsquo;s Hammer takes a grimmer view of how humanity would behave during the apocalypse.\nAnd so we get to the inevitable part where we discuss the dated aspects of the book. Yep, Lucifer\u0026rsquo;s Hammer was written in 1977, and its treatment of women, race and environmentalism is not in line with modern thinking.\n Lucifer's Hammer takes a grimmer view of how humanity would act during the apocalypse.  There are quite a few female characters (which is an improvement over The Mote In God\u0026rsquo;s Eye, at least), but they\u0026rsquo;re nearly always defined by their relationship to a male character. Maureen is Senator Jellison\u0026rsquo;s daughter. Dolores is Barry Price\u0026rsquo;s love interest. Marie Vance is Harvey\u0026rsquo;s neighbour. The only exception is the Russian doctor and kosmonaut Leonilla Malik, but she is part of the supporting cast. The book often makes reference to \u0026ldquo;women\u0026rsquo;s liberation\u0026rdquo; — a somewhat dated phrase — which I suppose was a big deal back in the 70s.\nAlthough the book has a few black characters (Rick Delanty, Hook and Alim Nasoor), the authors did choose to have a bunch of black people wind up as crazy cannibals by the third act. Okay, there are white cannibals too, but many of them are black. Alim Nasoor is also a murderer and a thief, which means the only non-white character who is also a decent bloke is astronaut Rick Delanty. There are no Asian characters, no Indians, no Australians\u0026hellip; The book is not outright racist (and I certainly don\u0026rsquo;t believe Niven and Pournelle harbour such attitudes, even in secret), but by today\u0026rsquo;s woke standards, it could have benefited from a more balanced cast of characters.\nThe book also has a dated view of environmentalism. Nuclear power is good, and those pesky environmentalists are always carrying on about CFCs in aerosol cans! Today, climate change is generally regarded as the single biggest threat to humanity — so to read a book that treats environmentalists as wackos is a bit worrying.\nWhether the above prevents one from enjoying the story is down to the individual. The book is 45 years old, and although I\u0026rsquo;m a pretty woke kind of person, I\u0026rsquo;m willing to forgive it for the most part. It\u0026rsquo;s never outright racist, sexist or anti-environment, but it does take a more conservative stance than the current, mainstream point of view. I found it a bit annoying more than anything, as the dated aspects sometimes jerked me out of the exciting story world.\nAll that being said, the book otherwise holds up remarkably well, considering its age. Niven and Pournelle are such a powerful writing team — the story is paced beautifully (despite being double the length of a typical novel), and the excitement builds and builds as the story progresses. Countless movies such as 2012, The Day After Tomorrow and Deep Impact owe a huge debt to Lucifer\u0026rsquo;s Hammer. Without books like this, I doubt we\u0026rsquo;d have those movies.\nOverall, Lucifer\u0026rsquo;s Hammer was a gripping read by the best in the business. Yes, some aspects of it are frustratingly dated, but if you can look past those faults, it\u0026rsquo;s an absolute ripping yarn, and a worthy addition to anyone\u0026rsquo;s sci-fi book collection.\n","summary":"Humanity is about to go the way of the dinosaur.

Although the Federation prevailed, liberating billions of Borg drones in the process, they suffered huge casualties and are now faced with the difficulties of rebuilding.\n 2381 — U.S.S. Aventine Chapter #1 Standing on holodeck 4, you’d never know that the warm sunshine was nothing but a trick of the light. Captain Ezri Dax wriggled her toes in the short-cut grass below. Manicured gardens, rich with red and white foliage, surrounded the neatly mowed lawn in which she and six others now waited. At the front of the pack stood Sam Bowers, her XO and friend. He grinned with expectation.\n“Welcome to the Aventine’s first-ever handstand class.” A soft murmur rose from the six people gathered before her. She continued, “Handstands have many benefits. They’re great for improving balance and building upper body strength. They keep you agile and get your blood pumping. But most importantly of all, they’re just plain fun to do.”\nBowers chuckled and said, “What made you want to share your secret superpower with us mere mortals?”\n“We’ve had a tough run of it lately,” Dax said. “I need this crew to be at its best. That means keeping fit, staying healthy, and occasionally having a little fun.” The diminutive Trill woman stepped into the small crowd before her, splitting them sideways. “Everyone take a big step back and watch me.”\nDax leaned in and tipped herself over, performing a textbook handstand. She could smell the grass, her nose just inches away from the plush green ground, as she performed the handstand.\nRighting herself, she straightened her Starfleet uniform and dusted her hands. “Easy as that.”\nThe crowd chuckled. Sam said, “Easy for you does not mean easy for us.”\n“Don’t worry, I’ll break it down for you all.”\nDax demonstrated her technique one step at a time. All eyes were locked on her as she ran them through how to stand initially, the movement of tipping over onto stretched-out arms and how to balance. “It’s a smooth motion, not a lunge,” she said. “Keep your arms straight as you approach the ground. Let the momentum carry you, and then straighten your legs and aim them towards the big blue up there.”\nGymnastics was a part of Ezri Dax. As a joined Trill, she had all the memories and life experiences of all her former hosts. In previous incarnations, Ezri Dax had lived as a scientist, a diplomat, a musical composer and a politician. But right now, it was Emony who quelled from deep within. Emony was a gymnast, so performing a handstand was no big deal.\nPresently, Dax walked around the circle and helped everyone, one by one. Lieutenant Naomi Darrow nearly headbutted the ground on her first attempt, but Dax helped her work through the movements. The portly Bolian Lieutenant Tharp seemed unable to commit to the full range of motion and required some encouragement to overcome his hesitation. The young Erin Constantino was not short on enthusiasm, deciding that constant repetition was an excellent way to learn something rather than focusing on form. Dax gently encouraged Constantino to slow down and concentrate on what her body was doing. The ensign nodded and grinned, evidently enjoying herself.\nSo far, the only person who’d managed to make their handstand stick was Commander Sam Bowers. She’d known him since her days on Deep Space Nine, and her heart was warmed by the fact he’d made the effort to come along, even though it probably wasn’t typically his idea of a good time. Plus, he was already pretty good at handstands.\nAs she approached Bowers, he performed a near-perfect handstand, walking around on his hands while his feet reached for the sky. He said, “If my legs give out, I can always get about like this.”\n“Impressive,” Dax said with a smile, feeling a bead of sweat drip from her brow. “If you ever retire from Starfleet, gymnastics could be your next gig.”\nBowers tumbled over and landed on his rump. A cheeky grin covered his handsome, ebony face. He said, “I was thinking something more like a circus performer. I’m sure there is a circus troop making their way around the deep space stations, delighting the locals.”\n“You would make an excellent clown.”\nA gentle breeze tickled the side of Dax’s face as she moved away from Sam, ensuring others got their share of her attention. She didn’t want to look like she favoured the more senior crew.\nSlowly, one by one, everyone except Tharp could perform something resembling a handstand. Dax stood in front of him and said, “Step forward and lean into it. I’ll catch your legs.”\n“Really?” he asked, a little breathless.\n“Just try not to kick your commanding officer in the face.”\nEveryone turned to look at the pair. Dax cringed. She hadn’t meant to draw attention to the one person who was struggling. A warm sensation worked its way up into her cheeks. She swallowed and said, “There is no harm in trying.”\nThe lieutenant rubbed the nape of his neck. “My mind is willing, but I can’t guarantee my body will follow.” He stepped forward, leaned into it, stretched out his arms and kicked with his legs. Two flailing ankles shot towards her.\nDax felt her hands naturally move to intercept Tharp’s ankles — grabbing just above his boots. She held him in the air, and a moment later, everyone was clapping. The portly Bolian was upside down and doing a handstand… with a bit of help. While she held him by the ankles, her combadge chirruped. Instinctively, she let go, tapped her badge and said, “Dax here.”\nTharp tumbled over. Wump!\n“Captain, you have an incoming transmission from Starfleet HQ.” The voice belonged to ops manager Gaff chim Nak, who was currently on the bridge.\nDax crouched down to check Tharp was okay. The Bolian smiled, and she mouthed to word sorry. Aloud, she said, “Pipe it through to me here, Lieutenant.”\nGaff chim Nak’s husky voice responded, “I believe Starfleet admirals prefer to keep their conversations private, rather than piped through the speakers of a holodeck for everyone to hear.”\nDax felt her heart skip a beat. “Right. Send it through to my ready room. And maybe beam me straight there. And replicate a cool towel.”\n“Anything else?”\n“Would you consider taking over my handstand class?”\n  A few moments later, Dax found herself surrounded by shimmering particles of light, and then she was in her ready room. A white towel waited for her on her desk. It was pleasantly cool to the touch when she gave herself a quick wipe down before tapping her console and bringing the Admiral online.\nThe face that appeared on the screen was instantly recognisable — Admiral Akaar. Famous for his tall body and a short fuse, Akaar was not known to mince words. He gave her a cold smile and said, “Am I interrupting something?”\nDax composed herself. “Sorry to keep you waiting, Admiral. I was putting the old Earth adage ‘healthy body, healthy mind’ into practice.”\nThe imposing Capellan admiral raised an eyebrow. “I’m afraid you’ll need to put your fitness plans on hold for the moment. We have an urgent mission for you.”\nNodding, Dax said, “No problem, Admiral. What are the details?”\n“During the Borg invasion, a lot of our ships fell off the map. People scattered. We’ve been doing our best to find survivors — any survivors. Starfleet just intercepted a weak subspace distress call from the U.S.S. Sequeira. Heard of it?”\nWith a frown, Dax said, “It doesn’t ring any particular bell for me.”\n“I’d be surprised if it did. The Sequeira started off life as a small science vessel but was hastily refitted as a warship during the invasion. All the crew were soft-headed boffins, some of them civilians. Like so many others, they had to pick up a pitchfork and march to the frontlines during the war. Anyway, they’re badly damaged and trapped in a subspace distortion anomaly — probably the result of the collapsed transwarp conduits the Borg were so fond of.”\n“It sounds like their time is running out,” Dax said, “and you need slipstream velocities to reach them.”\n“Correct,” Akaar said. “We have ships closer than yours, but even so, you can get there the fastest.”\nEzri’s ship, the U.S.S. Aventine, was one of only a handful of ships equipped with a quantum slipstream drive. This latest and greatest form of propulsion was still considered experimental, although no doubt soon enough, it would be standard issue across the fleet, replacing the older style warp engines.\n“I’m sending you the coordinates now. A word of warning, though. They’re trapped right on the edge of Federation space. Many salvagers and junk traders have been hovering around the edges of our territory, picking at the bones of war, hoping to find a little meat. Right now, the Federation does not need any new enemies. We need diplomats, not cowboys with their hands hovering by their phasers.”\n“Understood,” Dax said. Her mouth was slowly going dry. She eyed a glass of water on her table and took a small sip before continuing. “We’ll do our best to keep our torpedo bays locked, and our phasers powered down.”\n“One other thing,” Akaar said. The big man cleared his throat. “What the Federation also needs, right now, is a few good news stories. Spirits are low, and we’re worried that some may lose faith in our ways. Bring these men and women home, Captain Dax. That’s an order.”\nDax licked her dry lips. “Sounds like we better get moving.”\nAkaar gave a curt nod on the video screen. “Akaar out.”\nStealing a precious moment for herself, Dax leaned back into her chair and let out a long breath. She’d had a few admirals barking orders at her during the war, but when an armada of cubes filled to the brim with dead-eyed drones was heading your way — well, a grumpy admiral or two didn’t seem so bad. But now, in peacetime, a call from a Starfleet admiral was a little intimidating.\nHer mind turned to the mission she’d been given. I steered this ship through the invasion, she thought. I can handle a simple rescue mission.\nDax stood and marched through the sliding doors and onto the bridge. She heard the soft murmur of bridge chatter fall into silence. To her right, the turbolift doors opened. Commander Bowers stepped onto the bridge and gave her a subtle nod as he headed for his chair. She also noted Tharp had returned from the holodeck. He sat at the navigational console, a sleek shimmer of sweat still on his blue skin.\n“We have a mission,” Dax said to the room. “There is a vessel stranded on the edge of Federation space, and our spiffy little ship can reach them first. Mister Tharp, please calculate a course for these coordinates.” She transferred the numbers Akaar had given her to Tharp’s navigational controls. “And don’t forget to carry the one — we’re in a bit of a hurry.”\n“Aye,” he said.\nNext, Dax tapped her commbadge. “Bridge to engineering.”\n“Leishman here,” came the response. Mikaela Leishman, like Bowers, was another carry-over from Deep Space Nine.\n“Chief, I need our best possible speed and then a little more if you can manage it. We’re on a rescue mission, and I don’t intend to be the bearer of bad news to any of their families any time soon.”\n“Understood,” Leishman said. “I’ll unleash my hoard of highly trained tribbles into the slipstream now. They’ll keep it running smoothly.”\n“Whatever it takes, Mikaela. Dax out.”\nTaking a seat in the captain’s chair, she stared at the viewscreen — nothing much to see, other than a blanket of stars winking softly. Tharp turned to her and said, “Course calculated and plotted, and we have the thumbs up from engineering.”\nThe voice of Lonnoc Kedair came from behind. “These coordinates are the edge of Federation space. The very outer edge, at that.” The tough Tarkaran woman breathed through her nose. “There could be some trouble lurking in these waters.”\n“Let’s keep our weapons holstered for the moment, Lieutenant. But we should be prepared for the fact that not everyone may welcome our visit.”\n“Very well,” Lonnoc said.\nDax checked the ship’s vitals on her chair’s side panel. A series of green lights flashed across a diagram of the Aventine. All systems looked good.\n“Let’s do this,” Dax said. “Engage.”\nChapter #2 The U.S.S. Aventine engaged its engines and shot into the slipstream corridor, riding a wave of quantum fluctuations as it zipped towards its destination coordinates. From the soft hum that filled the bridge, Dax sensed that the slipstream drive was performing nicely.\n“Mr Tharp,” Dax said, “what’s our ETA to the Federation’s fence line?”\n“Three hours and fourteen minutes, Captain.”\nDax leaned over the edge of her chair and spoke to Sam in a hushed voice. “Join me in my ready room.”\nThe door to her ready room hushed open, and she made straight for the food replicator. “Raktajino, hot.” The rich, intense smell of the Klingon raktajino filled her nostrils. It evoked a deep sense of place and memory.\n“Feeling tired?” Sam asked, standing beside a high-backed chair. She motioned for him to take a seat.\n“It never hurts to be a little more alert,” Ezri said, cupping the hot drink in her hands. “I think Jadzia was a fan of these, along with half the crew of Deep Space Nine. Have you tried one?”\n“Not a big fan of caffeine,” Sam said. “I like to keep things natural.”\n“The old me was a bit that way. The joined me…” Dax shrugged.\nSam crossed his legs. “Anything on your mind, Cap?”\nDax placed the mug on the desk. “Was the handstand class a silly idea?”\nHer XO laughed. “Not at all. Everyone was grateful for the change of pace. The invasion is over — we came first, and the Borg came second. We can’t just sit around licking our sores.”\nWith a nod, Dax said, “I was hoping a few more people might have shown up. And I feel a bit bad about Tharp’s tumble.”\n“Bad timing,” Sam said and shrugged.\nTaking another sip of the raktajino, Dax felt the hot liquid slip down her throat. She said, “Every time I see a Starfleet admiral pop up on my video screen, I’m certain they’re calling to tell me that a real Starfleet captain is en route to take over the Aventine.” She paused and stared into her drink. “Some people spend their entire life trying to make captain. I somehow got there almost by accident and on a ship with a slipstream drive!”\nSam chided her gently. “You earned your rank during the Borg invasion. We all earned our ranks. I’ll tell you the one thing this ship doesn’t deserve — and that’s a Captain who let’s imposter syndrome and her self doubts get in the way.”\nDax felt her mouth dry out. “That’s harsh but fair.”\n“I didn’t mean you can’t talk to me about those things. That’s at least ten per cent of my job. But when you’re on the bridge, you’ve always handled yourself with grace and style. Whatever’s bubbling underneath, you’re cool and calm under pressure. You have lifetimes of experience under your belt. Trust me, you got this.”\nA smile warmed Dax’s face. “Thanks, Sam. Since you offered to be my listening post, my other major insecurity is that the only reason Starfleet haven’t stripped my field commission is a positive bias in favour of joined Trills. With so many past lives living inside of me, perhaps they’ve mistaken life experience for command experience.”\nRunning a hand over his short crop of tight curls, Sam said, “It’s not a bad thing to identify your insecurities. Self-awareness is important, as long as you balance it. Positive and negative.”\nShe finished off her raktajino. “Sounds like the handstand classes might continue then.”\n“I’ll be there.”\nDax glanced at the door that led to the bridge. “Keep an eye on things out there, will you?”\n“Aye.” Sam stood and took his leave.\nWhen the doors were closed, Dax placed her Starfleet issue boots on the desk. Sam Bowers was a fine XO, and she was lucky to have him. They’d worked together, on and off, for a few years. Memories stirred inside of her. The voice of the irrepressible Curzon Dax, a former Dax host, echoed in her mind: Being a leader is easy, he said, it simply takes honesty, integrity, humility and focus.\nYou were known to spin a web of lies now and then, Dax thought back. And humility isn’t the first word one might use to describe you.\nCurzon snorted — a strange sound to hear in one’s own head. Those who can’t do, teach.\nAs Curzon’s voice faded from her mind, Ezri Dax squared her shoulders and said aloud, “Honesty, integrity, humility and focus. I think I can manage that.”\n  “Captain to the bridge.”\nLonnoc Kedair’s husky voice snapped Dax from her reverie. Buried in Starfleet reports, duty rosters and preparatory intel for this region of space, Dax gladly put down her padd and tapped her combadge. “On my way.”\nAs Dax stepped onto the bridge, Lonnoc Kedair approached. Deep cranial ridges lined the Takaran woman’s forehead, brow and upper cheekbones, casting slanted shadows across her green skin. “Captain, we will arrive at our coordinates shortly.”\nDax acknowledged her Chief of Security with a curt nod. “We made good time.” She turned to her second officer. “Mr Helkara, scan the area. Let’s find our friends.”\n“Aye,” Helkara responded and tapped several commands into his console. “Nothing yet. Significant subspace distortions are interfering with our scans.”\n“Can you clean it up?” Bowers asked.\n“Once we’re out of the slipstream corridor, yes. For now, all I’m reading is sensor garble.”\nTharp chimed in. “Good news then, we’re slowing to impulse now.”\nDax gave Bowers a wry smile. “If we want to get the lay of the land, we can always do it the old fashioned way and look out the window.”\nSam smiled back and said, “On screen.”\nAgainst the pitch-black night, a small starship — the Sequeira — came into view. Segments of its hull were scalded and black, with hunks of metal wrenched away from their supports. Limp and lifeless, the Sequeira drifted aimlessly around a subspace eddy.\n“Lifesigns?” Dax asked.\n“Twelve —”\nKedair’s reply was cut short by another vessel moving to intercept. The Aventine rocked as the ship careened past. The thing was an ugly clump of green and grey metallic alloys, heavily armoured with a thick, reinforced hull. Its single nacelle burned a dirty red flame as it flew by.\n“Someone is busting in on our rescue mission!” Sam said.\n“That ship missed us by a coat of paint,” Dax said. “Who are they?”\nKedair wrangled with her tactical console before replying, “The other ship appears to be of Sidager design.”\n“Sidager…” Dax said, tasting the word in her mouth, feeling for familiarity. No memories stirred. “Why are they crashing our party?”\nKedair scowled. “The Sidager are poor junk traders with hacked together ships. Technologically speaking, they’re not exactly setting the trends. But they’re aggressive and unafraid to use force.”\n“Hail the Sidager vessel.”\nBefore she had time to take a breath, the Aventine’s viewscreen was flooded with an imposing alien visage — a Sidager woman. Her skin, encased in an array of brilliant white crescent-shaped scales, lined her neck, chin and cheeks — while two deeply-socketed silver eyes glared outwards. She spoke, and her deep, guttural voice filled the bridge. “Unidentified vessel, this salvage is ours.”\nDax spoke quickly. “I’m Captain Dax of the Federation starship Aventine. That ship out there is a Federation vessel stuck in —”\nThe screen went blank.\n“Captain,” Bowers said, “Two more Sidager vessels now coming into range.”\n“All ships are roughly of the same design,” Kedair noted, “One on one, we’re clear winners. One against three, and I wouldn’t be so eager to start a shooting match.”\nBower’s tapped the console mounted on his chair. “The other two ships aren’t as heavily armed as the lead ship. Sensor readings are a little weird — I think the subspace distortion isn’t helping. In any case, I don’t think they’re here for a playdate.”\nKedair said, “The lead ship is coming about, and it’s charging phasers. They’re targeting the Sequeira.”\nDax felt her hands grip tightly on her chair’s armrests. “Pursue the lead vessel, and put us between them and the Sequeira. Full impulse.”\nThe Aventine rocked as Tharp made a quick course change, moving to put the Aventine in the line of fire.\n“Why would they fire on the Sequeira if they plan to salvage her?” Bowers asked.\nThe question remained rhetorical as Dax stepped up and stood beside Lieutenant Commander Helkara. She studied the ops console. “Looks like they’re targeting life support with a tight beam phaser.” She placed a hand on Helkara’s arm and asked him directly, “Can we just beam the survivors out?”\n“All this subspace distortion means we’ll probably end up with nothing but humanoid soup on the transporter pads. I wouldn’t recommend it.”\nDax winced at the soup analogy but appreciated the point. Transporters were out. She said, “Hail them again.”\n“No response,” Kedair grunted.\nTharp wriggled in his chair. “Three seconds until we crash the party. Their phasers are at full charge.”\n“They’re firing!” Kedair called out.\nGrabbing hold of a nearby support railing, Dax felt the cold metal in her palm as she steadied herself. The Aventine shook, its shields absorbing the phaser’s beam. “Status?”\n“We took one for the team,” Kedair said. “The Sequeira crew may yet live to fight another day. Our shields are holding at 96 per cent.”\n“Hail them again,” Dax said.\nA moment later, the same fierce, feminine face filled the screen. “I admire your courage,” she said, “but we outnumber you and outgun you. This is your last warning. We claim this salvage.”\n“Wait,” Dax said, mentally uttering a quick, silent prayer that the viewscreen wouldn’t go blank. “We aren’t here to claim salvage. The people on that ship — the one you’re firing on — they are our friends. We’re the rescue team.”\nThe Sidager woman looked like she’d just bitten a raw Syto bean. “You are a Federation vessel?”\n“Yes,” Dax said. “As I said —“\n“The Federation border is about six ki’mi in that direction,” she motioned with what looked like a secondary opposable thumb. “I suggest you skulk back there.”\nAgain, the screen went blank. Dax said, “Mr Tharp, keep us between them and the Sequeira. We protect that vessel at all costs. Understood?”\n“Aye,” Tharp said.\nBowers clicked his tongue. “The other two ships are arming their torpedo bays, and the lead ship is powering up for a serious light show. I don’t know if we can take hits from three different directions. Our shields aren’t that good.”\n“Target the weapons on the lead ship,” Dax said. “Fire!”\nThe viewscreen showed a thick bolt of red light shooting towards the Sidager ship. A small eruption exploded on its port side. “Direct hit!” Kedair said.\n“The other two ships will be in range in about twenty seconds,” Bowers said.\nDax stood and snapped out an order. “Bring all three ships up on the main view screen. I want visuals.”\nHelkara tapped her console, and the viewscreen split into thirds. On each, a different Sidager ship was displayed. Bowers gave a low whistle and said, “They don’t look like much. But according to these scans, they sure pack a punch.”\nChewing the inside of her lip, Dax asked, “Is it possible they’re using the subspace distortions to hide a projection of false sensor readings?”\nGaff chim Nak answered from the science station. “The integrity of our scanning data is highly questionable. The other two ships could be nothing but unarmed freighters, projecting a few sensor shadows and pretending to be a whole lot scarier than they really are.”\n“Conjecture will get us nowhere,” Kedair said. “We can’t confidently protect the Sequeira from three ships coming in from three different angles.”\n“Lieutenant Tharp,” Dax said, “launch two sensor probes, targeted at each incoming Sidager vessel.”\nTharp hesitated for a brief moment before answering, “Yes, ma’am. Sensor probes away.”\n“The ships are now within firing range,” Kedair called out. “Can I at least fire a warning shot?”\nDax gave a curt nod. “Three warning shots — simultaneously across the bow of each vessel.”\nThe Aventine rumbled as its phasers burst into action. Each shot skidded past the hull of the incoming ships.\nThere was a short silence, which Bowers interrupted. “The sensor probes are returning data.”\n“And?” Dax asked.\nBowers snorted. “We called their bluff. These ships could barely beat me up for my lunch money, let alone take on the Aventine. Their so-called weapons are nothing but thoron fields and duranium shadows. They’re clever, but it turns out that they’re not well armed.”\n“Hail them one more time. I think they might be ready to talk.”\nChapter 3 The ops console chimed. Dax crossed her legs and suppressed a smile. The ops console chimed again. The bridge had grown quiet. All three Sidager ships were maintaining their current position.\n“Captain… should we respond to their hails?” Helkara asked.\n“Put them through.”\nThe Aventine’s viewscreen shifted from a split view of the three ships to the same face they’d seen earlier. The dazzling scales that formed the alien’s skin flushed a deep pink colour. “Federation vessel, you do not give up easily.”\nStanding, Dax took three steps towards the screen, taking her time in responding. “All we want to do is talk. Can we introduce ourselves? My name is Captain Ezri Dax of the U.S.S. Aventine. We belong to a peaceful coalition of planets called the Federation.”\n“I am aware of your Federation.”\n“Since we’re next-door neighbours, I thought you might have.”\n“Our people embrace a different set of ideals. I don’t need to hear a sermon on the virtues of your system.”\nDax blinked a couple of times. “I’ll put away my soapbox then.”\nThe alien flashed a set of jagged, yellow teeth. “I am Dominelle Ninsol Lisnon. My people are the Sidager. We claim this stranded ship as legitimate salvage.”\nOne-track mind, these people. “I didn’t fly all this way to argue with you over scrap metal. There are twelve lives on that ship. I’m not sure if you counted before you pointed your ship’s phaser at their life support systems.”\nNinsol Lisnon snarled. “We gave your people one pæya to evacuate into their escape pods. They refused.”\nPlacing her hands on her hips, Dax said, “Their escape pods are damaged. Along with half the ship.”\n“So they claim.”\nKedair’s voice broke into the conversation. “Captain, the Sequeira’s hull integrity is at 43 per cent and falling.”\nDax spoke to the viewscreen. “We’ve scanned your two other ships, and they’re packing fireworks, not firepower. We might be outnumbered but not outgunned, and we need to get our people off that ship. They’re trapped in a subspace distortion field, and their hull integrity is failing. Let us send over a shuttle and evacuate the crew. Meanwhile, you can beam over, and we’ll negotiate the rest.”\nLinsol scowled. “The moment your people are safe, you’ll scuttle the stranded vessel. It’s worth nothing to us if it’s in a million pieces.”\nDax clenched her fists. Ninsol Lisnon was correct — she would normally torpedo the ship to ensure Starfleet secrets didn’t find themselves on the black market. “I won’t scuttle the ship, you have my word.”\nFor several moments, the Sidager woman stared at Dax. Finally, she said, “Evacuate your friends.”\n“Thank you. Once they’re safely on board, we’ll contact you to beam over and begin negotiations.”\n“Make no mistake, Federation vessel. We may not be fully armed, but that doesn’t mean we’ll back down from a fight.”\nThe screen reverted to a view of all three Sidager ships.\nAfter letting out a long breath, Dax said, “Sam, get in the shuttlecraft Meuse and get our people safely back here.”\nWith a nod, Bowers said, “Helkara, you’re with me. We’ll pick up Doctor Tarses on the way.” The two officers marched to the turbolift and headed out.\nLonnoc Kedair approached Dax, and she didn’t look happy. “The Aventine has sufficient weaponry to disable all three ships,” the Chief of Security said, “and we could outrun them without even firing up the slipstream drive. Yet, you agree to hand over Starfleet property to a bunch of garbage collectors?”\nFeeling her shoulders arch back, Dax said, “The Federation isn’t looking to make any more enemies. I’ve lived enough lifetimes to tell you that things are a lot nicer when you leave the shooting as an absolute last resort.”\nKedair turned her head. “I’m not suggesting we destroy them. Just give them something to chew on.”\n“What if we anger them, and they ram the shuttle when it’s on its rescue mission? Or target the subspace distortions with a tachyon burst? Even without photon torpedoes, they can do damage.”\nDax took a moment to sit down in the captain’s chair and motioned for Kedair to sit in Sam’s usual spot. The Takaran said, “The Sidager vessel was prepared to kill twelve innocent people just for towing rights.”\n“Maybe so, but why not lead by example?”\n“This could make us look weak. And as your chief of security, I have to remind you that we should scuttle the Sequeira.”\nIt’s time to scuttle this conversation, Dax thought. “Noted. For now, please work with Tharp and Ensign Riordan on analysing the sensor readings from our two probes. These people slip through sensors like shadows in the night. If nothing else, I want to bulk out Starfleet’s intel on the Sidager. Trust me, the Sidager dossier is a quick read.”\n“Understood,” Kedair said and rose from the XO’s seat.\nSettling into her chair, Dax said, “Let’s get a look at the Sequeira.” The screen shifted to a view of the stranded starship, and revealed the shuttle Meuse heading out on its rescue mission. Dax pictured Sam onboard the small shuttlecraft, piloting it with Helkara, while Doctor Tarses prepped his medical tricorder. Saving twelve souls would make today a good day. Twelve lives otherwise thought lost.\nTwelves lives now just minutes away from rescue.\n  Commander Sam Bowers sat comfortably in the pilot’s chair, even when the shuttle rocked and jerked. Doctor Tarses, however, was almost thrown from his seat as they narrowly avoid a subspace eddy. Sam made quick adjustments to the computer’s projected pitch and yaw, compensating for the subspace anomalies.\n“Not the smoothest flight of my life,” the doctor said.\nSam chuckled. “I think the inertial dampers need some tweaking.”\nHelkara chimed in. “This region of space is a checkerboard of eddies and subspace microfractures. Some turbulence is expected.”\nBowers piloted the craft, aligning it with Sequeira’s docking port. “Nice and easy…” Sam muttered as he nudged the Meuse through a rough patch. “Extending docking clamps.”\nThe Meuse rocked slightly as a satisfying snap-click echoed through the small ship.\n“Nicely done,” Helkara said. “Docking complete.”\nDoctor Tarses rose from his seat, ducking below a bulkhead. “Let’s get the sick and injured on first. Hopefully, no one is so badly hurt that they can’t be moved.”\nThe airlock cycled, then swung open. Sam stepped through and onto the Sequeira. Suffocating clouds of smoke billowed out from the battered lower bulkheads, while exposed wires and cracked plasma conduits sent sparks flying in all directions. Through the hazey blanket caused by the ship’s damaged environmental systems, Sam saw three people rushing around the corner to greet them.\n“They’re Starfleet!” shouted a tall man with cracked lips and a short, scruffy beard. He jogged towards them, favouring his right leg. He extended a hand. “Please tell me I’m not hallucinating.”\n“I’m flesh and blood,” Sam replied.\nThe man patted down his uniform. “I’m Captain Madison Short. And you are aboard what’s left of the Sequeira.” The Captain gestured to the two others that had followed him. “This is lieutenants Walker and Si’aqa.”\nBowers let go of the long handshake. The two lieutenants nodded their hellos. Bowers said, “We have a small shuttlecraft docked and everyone is welcome. You can all fit if you don’t mind rubbing shoulders.”\n“To say we’re grateful would be an understatement,” the captain said. He turned to his two subordinates. “Go round up the others.”\nDoctor Tarses inserted himself into the conversation. “Does anyone require urgent medical treatment?”\nCaptain Short nodded. “Ensign Juanne has a collapsed lung. Our EMH is offline, along with just about every other system.”\nTarses and Helkara followed Walker and Si’aqa in search of Ensign Juanne. As they walked around the corner and disappeared from view, Captain Short said, “Most of our sensors are down, but we did detect your vessel. And three Sidager ships. I hope you didn’t suffer any casualties.”\nBowers rubbed the nape of his neck. “Captain Dax negotiated with the Sidager. They shouldn’t pose any immediate danger.”\nCaptain Short’s eyes narrowed. “This ship is beyond saving, but those junkers out there will tear it apart and sell it off, piece by piece. We can’t let it fall into their hands. I should set a self-destruct once my crew are clear.”\n“Not necessary,” Bowers said. “In the interests of peace, Captain Dax has tentatively agreed this vessel will be handed over. Call it a gesture of goodwill.”\nThe Captain’s mouth gaped. “This was a science vessel, retrofitted as a ship of war. Our databanks contain Starfleet tactical data. Our warp engine is unique and not commercially available outside the Federation. We also have a cache of photon torpedoes, although we’re too banged up to launch them. I don’t want to see Starfleet intel being auctioned at an Orion Syndicate dinner party.”\nBowers nodded. “I understand. I’m sure Captain Dax will secure all sensitive data and equipment. But for now, my orders are to get you and your crew off this ship and onto the Aventine, and maybe we can throw in a hot meal and a sonic shower too.”\nThe first group of surviving crew members came around the corner and formed behind Captain Short. Bowers counted seven. Three more came in shortly after, followed by Tarses and Helkara helping a young Ensign — his gangly arms hooked around their shoulders. The young Ensign looked like he wasn’t even old enough to shave.\nCaptain Short took a step to the side and gestured. “Get my crew to safety.”\n“All aboard,” Bowers said. “This is one train you don’t want to miss.”\nOne by one, the crew stepped through the airlock and onto the shuttle. They limped along on unsteady feet, and each cast a tired yet hopeful glance in Bower’s direction as they walked by. Only one person remained.\n“Time to say goodbye to your old ship,” Bowers said.\nCaptain Short squared his shoulders and said, “No. I’m staying put.”\n  “You’re doing what?” Dax asked, feeling her face grow flush with heat.\nDax was seated at her ready room desk. On the screen was another Starfleet captain — her counterpart Madison Short of the U.S.S. Sequeira. The man’s eyes were bloodshot and never seemed to blink. He said through the video com, “I have to stay on. If the Sidager are to have this ship, they’ll have a buffet of priceless Starfleet intel at their fingertips.”\n“Captain Short, unless your ship is the clothesline on which Starfleet airs all its dirty laundry, I think we can handle it. The Sidager Dominelle Ninsol Lisnon is beaming here as we speak. I will work something out.”\n“I don’t think you understand. Were you on the front lines during the invasion?” Short asked.\n“Trust me, we were there. Every scrap of metal with a warp core was deployed when the Borg paid us a very unwelcome visit. But the war has been and gone. It’s time to put the paranoia back in the box and bring out some of that old fashioned Starfleet.”\nThe Captain sneered, then suddenly changed tact. “I’m grateful for the rescue. Are all my crew safe? Will Ensign Juanne live? A console exploded in the poor kid’s face. Twice.”\n“Yes and yes. The young Ensign is a fighter, and our chief medical officer expects he’ll be crawling the Jeffries tubes again in no time. But Captain —”\n“Go negotiate.”\nDax’s mouth fell open as the video screen switched back to the Starfleet insignia. He hung up. Shaking her head, Dax resisted the urge to bash her desk with a fist. Then she did it anyway. A jolt of pain coursed through her arm and into her shoulder. The Sidager Dominelle was due to beam over any minute now. Dax collected herself and tried to calm her mind in preparation for the negotiation ahead.\nChapter #4 On one side of the table sat Security Chief Lonnoc Kedair. On the other side, about five meters away, sat the Sidager Dominelle Ninsol Lisnon. The two women stared at each other from across the table, their eyes locked in some kind of silent battle.\nDax said, “Welcome to the Aventine.”\nThe Sidager woman’s eyes moved to the room’s viewscreen window. Endless black night swam with a sea of distant stars. Ninsol Lisnon said, “I can’t remember the last time I looked out a window and counted the lights.”\n“How many are there?” Dax asked.\n“Too many to ever feel safe.” Ninsol Lisnon paused. “That’s about as philosophical as you’ll hear me get. We need to talk business.”\nHovering by the seat next to Ninsol’s, Dax hesitated. Something about this room — the long desk reflecting the ceiling lights, the angled beige walls and grey bulkheads — it just didn’t feel right. Dax pondered: had Ninsol just shown her a glimpse of her true self, behind all the bravado and threats?\n“How about a tour?” Dax asked. “We can stare at the stars any time.”\nKedair snapped to attention. “Captain, if I might suggest from a security perspective we —”\nHolding up a hand, Dax smiled and said, “It’s quite okay Chief. I promise we won’t get lost.”\nThe Security Chief crossed her arms and huffed. “May I join you?”\n“Of course,” Dax said. “The more, the merrier. Ninsol, I’m a big fan of walking and talking. Would you join me for a brief tour?”\nNinsol cast a wary gaze at Dax. “I don’t see the harm.”\nUshering them out into the corridor, Dax started to walk with Ninsol by her side. Kedair lurked a meter or so behind. “The Aventine is a vesta-class, multi-mission ship. That’s Starfleet jargon for ‘it goes fast and can travel a long way’.”\nWith a slight chuckle, Ninsol said, “Impressive. Our scans indicated you don’t use a traditional warp engine. Correct?”\n“It’s called a quantum slipstream drive. We stole it from the Borg. Sort of.”\nNinsol was silent for a moment. “Your Federation certainly paid a price for it. I hope it was worth it.”\nLowering her gaze, Dax said, “The Borg invasion was devastating. But we’re rebuilding. Hope is back. The people of the Federation are eternal optimists.”\nThey continued to walk down the corridor. Ensign Englehorn walked by them, giving Dax a nod before hurrying on. Ninsol said, “The Borg did not spare the Sidager. That ship that we are trying to salvage could give my people the food and medical care they need.”\n“How much does a pre-loved Starfleet vessel sell these days?” Dax asked.\n“Not as much as it should, once the Sidager Exchange takes its 60 per cent. Not to mention the various donations we need to give to the Bounty Stewards in this area.”\nThe trio turned a corner and entered the main bridge. The crew snapped to attention. “At ease,” Dax said. “We’re just passing through.”\nNinsol paused, taking in the Aventine’s bridge with a wide-eyed stare. “Something tells me you just wanted to show off.”\n“Maybe a little,” Dax said with a smile. “We have dedicated science, operations, communications and engineering sections. And navigation, of course.” Dax pointed to the captain’s chair. “I get the best seat in the house.”\nThey continued through the turbolift, Kedair still with them. “Deck sixteen,” Dax commanded. The lift whirred to life.\n“I’m curious,” Ninsol said, “why didn’t you simply transport your stranded crew off the Sequeira?”\n“We couldn’t get a solid lock through all the subspace interference.”\nWith a cock of her head, Ninsol offered a small smile. “We developed a way to compensate by modifying the transport buffer relay to use a series of external nodes mounted to our hull.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Perhaps we’re not quite so far down the technological food chain as you first thought?”\nDax clasped her hands behind her back. “I’m curious, since you’re obviously well adapted to this region of space — did something prevent you from helping the Sequeira crew instead of shooting at their life support system?”\nIn the tight confines of the turbolift, she watched Kedair from the corner of her eye. The Security Chief’s hand lowered to her phaser.\n“We aren’t slave traders,” Ninsol said. “Nor are we people smugglers. We would have at least allowed them to die with their dignity intact.”\nThe turbolift doors hissed open and the trio walked on towards the mess hall. Dax said, “In any case, now we have the crew safely off the Sequeira, here is my offer: we can tractor the ship to a safe location, away from the subspace distortions. We will purge the databanks and strip the bio-neural gel packs. The warp engine, the warp core and the dilithium tanks are coming with us too. That also means the dilithium incubator, regulator, and sequencer are not part of the package.”\nNinsol scoffed. “There won’t be a ship left by the time you remove all that.”\n“There will still be plenty there to pick over.”\nThey came to a small, round table in the mess hall. Dax took a seat, and Ninsol followed suit. Kedair stood with her arms crossed and mumbled, “I’ll replicate us some drinks.”\nThe two Starfleet officers looked at Ninsol. The Sidager said, “Water.”\nDax drummed the table with her fingers. “I’ll have water as well. Sparkling. With a wedge of lime and lots of ice.”\n“Bitters and vodka too?” Kedair asked.\n“Maybe once these negotiations are settled.”\nKedair went to get the drinks. Ninsol leaned back away from the table and said, “Your terms are unacceptable. We will be taking the warp core at the very least. And the dilithium stores are worth more than all the alloys in the hull of ten ships.”\nDax mentally ran through her list of no-go items versus what she could give up. “I can let you keep half the dilithium. But if I give away the warp core, I will have to give away my Starfleet commission while I’m at it.”\nThe drinks arrived, and Kedair joined the table. Ninsol scowled, baring her yellow teeth. “Every dilithium storage tank will remain on board.”\n“But no warp core,” Dax said and took a sip of the bubbly water. The cool drink absorbed into her hot, dry mouth.\n“Fine. You can keep the dilithium processing units if you throw in one of your sensor probes.”\nAfter glancing at Kedair, who gave her a microscopic shrug, Dax said, “As long as we can purge the memory buffers.”\n“Agreed.” Ninsol took a gulp of water. “We get the keep the cache of photon torpedoes as well.”\nDax winced, and she noticed Kedair’s posture grow rigid. “You aren’t slave traders, and we aren’t arms dealers.”\n“Unacceptable,” Ninsol growled. “We need those torpedoes to defend ourselves.”\n“We can compensate for it with food and medical supplies.”\nAn unfamiliar ringing sound echoed through the mess hall. Ninsol took a communications device from her tunic pocket and pressed a button. A voice chimed through. “Dominelle, we have a problem.”\n“I’m busy.”\n“A human has remained on board the Sequeira. They’ve set a self destruct sequence. It’s going to blow in less than five piyia.”\nBolting upright in her seat, Dax tapped her combadge and said, “Dax to bridge. Scan the Sequeira and tell me nothing is counting down.”\nThere was a moment of silence, followed by Helkara’s voice. “A self destruct has been initialised.”\n“On whose authorisation?” Dax asked.\n“Captain Madison Short.”\nSwearing under her breath, Dax quickly sought to bring the situation under control. “We had no idea he’d do that.”\nNinsol stood, her chair tumbling sideways to the floor. It landed with a clang. “You knew the human named Short had remained on the ship?”\n“He refused to leave,” Dax said, stammering a little. “He said he wanted to purge some of the data banks. It’s not like I outrank him.”\nNinsol sent her water glass flying across the room. Liquid sloshed everywhere. “You’ve done an excellent job stalling for time.”\n“That wasn’t —”\nThe imposing Sidager woman interrupted, speaking into her handheld communicator. “Beam me back to the Gena Uanna.”\nDax watched as a swirl of blue light enveloped Ninsol Lisnon until all that stood before her was a puddle of spilled water and an upturned chair.\nJust great.\nStraightening her uniform, Dax reached deep into her memories. What was it that Curzon had said? Being a leader is easy. It simply takes honesty, integrity, humility and focus…\nCurzon always had been an arrogant bastard.\n  Only the pale luminescence of emergency lighting lit the bridge now. The putrid smell of melting plastics and stale ozone filled the air. Captain Madison Short knelt on one knee and reached under the ops console. His hand touched something hot. Taking a rag from his pocket, he wrapped it around his dirty hand and tried again. This time, the data nodule came loose.\nWho’s uniform had this rag come from? From which lifeless body had he taken it? Ensign Nunez? Lieutenant Shaw? Or that one crewman they’d had on the Sequeira… They teased her because she’d flunked probability mechanics at the academy. At the time, the teasing seemed good-natured. Now he realised they were being mean.\nThe crewman’s name… what was it?\n“Five minutes and thirty seconds until self destruct. Evacuate. Evacuate.”\nCaptain Madison Short thought back to when he’d accepted this commission; a small science vessel studying gamma-ray radiation spikes from neutron stars — specifically their periods of intense hypersonic vibrations. In theory, these vibrations could speed up subspace communications due to how they interacted with gravitational waves. It was cutting edge science.\nThose had been good days.\nJust months later, the Borg had slain half of his crew. Gaping holes had been wrenched in the Sequeira’s hull — replicators broken and shields beyond repair. Catastrophic cascade failures had engulfed the entire ship, with life support hanging by a thread.\nShort felt his hands forming into fists. Under his command, two dozen scientists had been forced to take up arms and join the war effort. Starfleet had hastily retrofitted two torpedo bays onto their ship. Before they knew it, a Borg armada came screaming into their region of space. It was like an ant fighting a herd of elephants.\n“Five minutes until self destruct. Evacuate. Evacuate.”\nHe fired up the plasma torch and set it on the data nodule. The burst of concentrated heat burned through the casing until the insides of the nodule sizzled and popped. A thin plume of smoke eased out. It smelled toxic. An involuntary cough escaped his lips. Another data nodule wiped clean, just in case anything survived the forthcoming explosion.\n“Dax to Short. Captain, our sensors indicate you’ve lit the fuse on the Sequeira. You have to stop it. Lives are at stake.”\nShort wiped his face with a dirty sleeve. The air around him thinned. He muttered a curse. “My people are safe on your ship… Captain Ezri Dax of the Aventine…”\nThe Captain spoke only to himself. He’d never activated his com.\nA loud crack burst through from the aft section of the ship. The Sequeira was only small and not built for fighting. The two dozen men and women had lived in close quarters with each other. Some had triple bunked. They had been out there for science, not looking for a fight.\nPresently, Short glanced up at the viewscreen, which hadn’t worked for 26 days. Out there was an intricate maze of subspace distortions and microscopic space-time fissures. It would appear to Starfleet that the collapsed Borg transwarp hubs were the cause of this maze of spatial anomalies.\nWould his crew keep his secret? Probably not.\n“Captain Short, come in. Please.”\nOver now to the next console. The data banks needed purging. Nothing could be left to chance.\nCaptain Short had never seen a starship self destruct.\nChapter #5 The Aventine was at yellow alert. Dax paced the floor while Sam sat in the XO’s chair. The bridge oozed a sense of quiet panic, even though Dax could see every officer remaining calm. Goosebumps formed on her arms.\n“Mr Nak,” Dax said. “Estimate of the blast radius?” The words felt thick in her throat.\nThe Tellarite stroked his beard and said, “With a ship of that size, anything within 500 000 kilometres would be either destroyed or in for a very bad day.”\n“Five minutes until it self destructs,” Kedair announced.\nShe tapped her combadge. “Dax to Short. Captain, our sensors indicate you’ve lit the fuse on the Sequeira. You have to stop it. Lives are at stake.”\nNo response.\nSwearing under her breath, she heard a nearby console chime. Kedair said, “The Sidager ships are moving in.”\nEven now, with the entire ship set to blow, they’d attempt to save their quarry. Desperate people. Drastic measures.\nLooking up at the viewscreen, Dax saw the three Sidager ships each set a tractor beam on the Sequeira.\nBowers said, “They’re attempting to contain the blast with their tractor beams. Minimise the damage and salvage what they can.”\nDax tapped her combadge and tried again. “Captain Short, come in. Please.”\n“No response,” Helkara said.\n“Four and a half minutes until it self destructs.”\nTime is running out. Dax took a breath and tried to slow her beating heart. The Sidager ships didn’t stand a chance if the Sequeira detonated. She turned to Helkara at ops and said, “I need two feet firmly planted inside the Sequeira. Can you get me there?”\nThe Zakdorn grimaced. “Our transporters just won’t work with all this subspace distortion. I might be able to get your feet there, but I can’t guarantee the rest of your body will follow.”\nShe looked at Bowers and said, “I know someone who can transport me.”\nThe Aventine’s XO shook his head. “Oh no. No way. It’s too risky.”\n“I gave the Sidager my word we wouldn’t scuttle the Sequeira. We could have used this encounter as a starting point to build a better relationship with one of our neighbours. Instead, this will drive a wedge between us.”\n“Send me instead,” Bowers said.\n“I made some inroads with Ninsol Lisnon, and we built something of a rapport. I might be able to get her to see reason.”\nBowers nodded gravely.\n“Get the Sidager on the line.”\nThe ops console chimed twice. “I have them,” Helkara said. “Audio only.”\nDax spoke to the room. “Ninsol Lisnon, this is Captain Ezri Dax. I need you to transport me to the Sequeira.”\nThe voice on the other line gave a bitter laugh. “So you can help your Starfleet man escape?”\n“I might be able to deactivate the self destruct. Or I can talk him around.”\n“We have done enough talking.”\n“No, actually, we haven’t.” Dax cast her eyes at the viewscreen. It showed three cones of blue light streaming from the Sidager ships — they were using triangulated tractor beams in the hopes of containing the explosion. She continued, “We’ve hardly talked at all. Talking is free. It doesn’t cost resources. Or lives. It doesn’t charge a tax. Talking is the beginning of peaceful trade. Talking is how friendships form. I want to keep talking with you. With the Sidager. I’m asking you to help me make this right.”\nA brief pause. Then, “Lower your shields.”\nGiving the nod to Kedair, the shields powered down. Time stood still as blue particles of light surrounded her and then faded. Once on the Sequiera, she gasped. The bridge was shadowed in thick, hazy smoke, and she gagged on the acrid air as she covered her mouth with her sleeve. An intense heat bathed her skin, forcing her body into slow, careful movements. Her eyes scanned the room and found the captain sitting in his chair surrounded by slagged data nodules and a plasma torch.\n“Captain!” she yelled. “Madison!”\nBlank, distant eyes cast in her direction as the chair slowly turned. His mouth was slightly agape. He said nothing.\n“Computer, cancel self destruct. Authorisation Captain Ezri Dax Echo Six Zero Six.”\n“Unable to comply.”\nDax grimaced. “Computer, engage self destruct override timer. Two hours. Authorisation Captain Ezri Dax Echo Six Zero Six.”\n“Unable to comply.”\nStumbling, Dax approached Captain Short. The man looked merely a shadow of a Starfleet officer. A console exploded nearby, letting out a hideous snap and sending sparks flying. Closer now, Dax said, “Order this ship to abort its self destruct.”\nThe man just stared over her shoulder.\nShe crouched down and forced their eyes to meet . A glimmer of life was still there, perhaps. Softly, Dax said, “Captain, if this ship self destructs, you’re going to kill at least forty Sidager people. Don’t make murder your swan song.”\nHe mumbled, “We… were just scientists.”\n“Two minutes and thirty seconds until self destruct. Evacuate. Evacuate.”\nThe ship’s computerised voice warbled. She refocused on the captain. “Yes, you were just scientists. But you were also Starfleet officers. Duty calls and we answer. You answered. The entire crew here showed bravery and courage —”\n“We hid!” Short shouted. “The subspace distortions here aren’t the result of collapsed Borg transwarp tunnels. They’re naturally occurring, and we used them to hide.” Tears streamed down his dirty cheeks. “We hid while the others perished. And then we got stuck.”\n“Two minutes until self destruct. Evacuate. Evacuate.”\nThe captain continued, his words pouring out. “The Borg fired one shot at us. One solitary shot, and we were finished — shields down, cascading system failures, near-total destruction. We had to reroute emergency power to sustain life support. Holes dotted our hull. Bodies went flying as the atmosphere vented into space. It was like watching pure chaos in slow motion. Terrifying.”\n“One minute and thirty seconds until self destruct. Evacuate. Evacuate.”\nDax took him by the shoulders. “Your ship was damaged beyond repair. You saved eleven lives, plus your own, by hiding here.”\n“Cowards!” he yelled. “How could I look my son in the eye? Every other starship within sensor range suffered. People were assimilated while we hid in the corner of the room and played dead.”\n“You did your best.”\nCaptain Short gurgled something unintelligible. Spittle formed in the corner of his lips. The man was so entirely overcome by survivors guilt that he was merely a husk.\nI’m running out of time, Dax thought. And I’m getting nowhere. I need him to override the self destruct. The computer won’t accept my commands.\nThe voice of Curzon echoed in her mind: Honesty, integrity, humility and focus…\nDax stood up straight, body rigid — her voice her own but infused with Curzon’s powerful articulation. “Stand up, Captain. On your feet.”\nDespite his disdainful stare, he pushed himself out of the chair.\nBlood pounded in Dax’s temples. She said, “You made a decision. You hid your crew. It was neither a triumphant hallmark of bravery nor an act of cowardice. It was a decision, and you made it. As Starfleet captains, we own our decisions. Right or wrong. I’ve made my share of mistakes. I’ve had eight lifetimes worth of mistakes, and I’ll tell you that sometimes I wake up in the night, covered in sweat.”\n“One minute until self destruct. Evacuate. Evacuate.”\nShe continued, “But all that is done. Right now, I need you to accept your mistakes just as I have accepted mine. Focus on me. Focus on the good in us both. Focus on the fact that we can save lives. People are alive now. We can save them.”\nShort’s eyes widened as he wiped wet tears from his cheeks. “A captain… should go down…”\n“No,” She interrupted. “Disengage the self destruct. Then go visit your son.”\n“Thirty seconds until self destruct. There will be no further warnings.”\n“They tell me my son is alive…” He choked, recovered, and then finally said, “Computer. Deactivate self destruct. Authorisation…” A blank look passed across his face.\nDax mouthed the words, “Captain Madison Short.”\nHe nodded. “Authorisation Captain Madison Short zero three alpha.”\n“Self destruct aborted.”\nFor a moment, Dax thought her body might crumple into a heap. But to her mild surprise, she remained standing — as a flash of hot, burning anger coursed through her. This man had nearly killed himself, her, and forty Sidager! But when she looked at him square on, her anger cooled into empathy.\nDax embraced Short. It was almost comical, as he stood at least a head taller than her. But he leaned into it like it was the first act of human compassion he’d ever encountered. His body felt warm, limp and bony. She wondered about the last time he’d eaten. Or had any water, for that matter.\nWith a gentle nudge, she separated herself from him and tapped her combadge. “Aventine, come in. What’s your status?”\nThe voice of Sam Bowers piped through. “We detected the aborted self destruct. Well done. But you better get off that ship sooner rather than later; it’s looking in pretty rough shape. The Sidager have remained in place.”\n“Can you ask Ninsol Lisnon to beam us both directly to the Aventine?”\n“Stand by.”\nThe interior of Aventine’s sickbay faded into view. Doctor Tarses rushed over with a young orderly and caught hold of Short’s body as he sagged helplessly. The orderly manoeuvred Short over to a bed while Tarses remained with Dax. He asked, “Everything okay?”\n“That depends on what exactly happens next,” Dax said.\nDoctor Tarses issued a hypospray to counter the toxic fumes that Dax had inhaled while on the Sequiera. She promised that she’d return for a complete medical exam just as soon as the immediate crisis was over.\nRight now, she was needed on the bridge.\n  “Situation report,” Dax ordered.\nSeated in the XO’s chair, Bowers gave her a sly smile. “Do you want the good news or the good news?”\n“Give it to me in the reverse of whatever order you’d originally intended.”\n“Umm. Right. In that case… we’ve agreed with the Sidager that the Aventine will tractor the Sequeira to a safe location. Its hull is badly damaged, but it should be stable enough once it’s free of all these subspace anomalies. They’ve also agreed to our terms regarding the removal of sensitive Starfleet material.”\n“Even the warp core?”\nHe grinned. “Even the warp core.”\n“Wow,” Dax said, rubbing the nape of her neck. She looked around; everyone on the bridge was beaming smiles in her direction. “Did I miss something? Don’t tell me we convinced the Sidager to join the Federation too?”\nBowers gave a small chuckle. “The news isn’t that good. But everything is set. You just need to give the word.”\nEyeing him with deep suspicion, Dax asked, “The Sidager didn’t even haggle? Or perhaps threaten to blow us up? Something tells me this all happened a bit too easily.”\n“A bit too easily!” Kedair said, marching down from her security station to join the conversation. “You were seconds away from being blown up.”\nNarrowing her eyes, she focused on Sam Bowers. He hesitated before responding. “We broadcast your com signal to the Sidager ships. They heard the radio drama that took place between you and poor Captain Short.”\nDax felt her fists clench. “You broadcast a private conversation between two Starfleet captains?”\nBowers took half a step back. “How else could we convince them that our motives were pure? I must say, Captain, you give a hell of a speech.”\n“Commander, that was a brilliant idea.”\nRelief sagged the lines of his face. “Thank you.”\n“They didn’t trust us,” Dax said. “That was always the issue. Yes, they made some unappealing choices and fired on the Sequeira with people still wandering its halls. But today, we might have just built a little trust. And that can go a long way.”\nBowers breathed. “Permission to proceed as planned?”\nDax nodded. “Tractor the old girl to safety and begin stripping her of our dirty little secrets. Then we can hand her over with a clean conscience.”\nThe bridge hummed with action. Helkara communicated with the Sidager ships and coordinated the tractor beam handover to the Aventine. Kedair assembled a team to board the ship once it was stabilised. Doctor Tarses and his team continued to help the casualties — in particular Captain Short, who was badly malnourished and dehydrated.\nDax just had one thing left to do.\nEpilogue Ezri stepped into her ready room. She’d just been on the holodeck, working out with Lonnoc Kedair. They had been trying out a peculiar human exercise style called aerobics. It’d been fun, if a little strange.\nPresently, the console on her desk blinked with a dot of pale orange light. Taking a moment to collect herself, she noticed the towel, neatly folded, waiting for her on her desk. Gaff chim Nak was on the bridge today, and she knew he’d replicated the towel for her, anticipating her post-workout needs. It was pleasantly cool to the touch, and her skin tingled as she dabbed it on her flush face.\nWhy do Starfleet generals always call when I’m exercising?\nSeated, she blew a little air on her face by flapping her hand. It didn’t help much. She pressed the button on the table, and Admiral Akaar’s big head filled the screen, replacing the Starfleet insignia.\n“Admiral, it’s good to see you again.”\n“And you, Captain.” The Capellan man’s baritone voice boomed through the screen’s tiny speakers. “Congratulations on your successful mission. Twelve lucky people are now breathing free air and reconnecting with those who also survived the invasion.”\nDax smiled. “It was quite a rescue mission, but I’m grateful it turned out okay.”\n“I heard you came across a few Sidager junk traders?”\n“Nothing the crew and I couldn’t handle.”\nAkaar leaned back from the screen. “Good, good. Speaking of the Sidager, an interesting report came across my desk today.”\n“Oh?” Dax felt her eyebrows raise.\n“It would seem the same people you had a run-in with found yet another stranded Starfleet vessel, out near the Argelius Sector. These Sidager have a good nose for valuable salvage.”\nDax scrunched up her face. “Is this a happy ending type story?”\nThe big admiral laughed. “Indeed it is, Captain Dax. Instead of shooting or making threats, they offered them food, water and medical supplies. It would seem they had plenty to spare.”\nDax swallowed down a lump in her throat. “Is that so?”\nAfter the Sidager had accepted her terms (thanks in part to Sam’s quick thinking in broadcasting her emotional appeal to Captain Short) the crew had stripped the Sequeira of its warp engine and warp core, replacing it with barrels of triptacederine, chloromydride, stenophyl, cortical analeptics, analeptic compounds, general use medkits, Bajoran wheat, Kohlanese barley, corn (from Earth), and raw algae suitable for the Sidager protein resequencers. Enough food and medical supplies to keep them going for quite a while.\n“I’ve known a few generous Starfleet captains in my time. But after surviving a devastating Borg invasion, did you consider the Federation citizens who could have benefitted from those food and medical supplies?”\nLifting her chin, Dax said, “It would seem that some Federation citizens did benefit from those supplies. Sir.”\nAdmiral Akaar’s eyes narrowed, and then he let out a hearty guffaw. “I suppose they did. You’ll have your new mission briefing within the day. Akaar out.”\nThe round face and ruddy cheeks that belonged to the Admiral faded from the screen, replaced by the Starfleet insignia. Dax placed the cool towel around her shoulders and smiled.\n","summary":" Historian’s Note\nThe following takes place shortly after the events depicted in Star Trek: Destiny, in which the Federation is invaded by the Borg.

I was a print purist. A physical book has that weight, smell, and special something that makes it special.\nOr so I thought.\nThen, a couple of years ago, I saw the Kobo Clara HD on sale at JB HiFi. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t a huge discount ($30), but I decided to give it a go for whatever reason. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I\u0026rsquo;d call the decision life-changing, but it certainly changed the way I read books.\nFirstly, why did I choose a Kobo over an Amazon Kindle? Because I despise the idea of lining Jeff Bezos\u0026rsquo; pockets with any of my hard-earned dollars. As simple as that. But the Kobo had some other advantages too: easy sideloading of epubs, Overdrive support for borrowing ebooks from a public library, and a screen light thattransitions out the blues as it approaches evening, which can help you get a better night\u0026rsquo;s sleep (I think the Kindle has since copied this feature).\n(In the interest of fairness — I should note that the Amazon Kindle Store does have a slightly more extensive collection of ebooks — particularly older books. E.g. Lucifer\u0026rsquo;s Hammer by Niven and Pournelle is not available on the Kobo store whatsoever, but it is on the Kindle).\nBut actually, a couple of years on, the biggest reason why I have stuck with mainly reading ebooks on my Kobo is simply this: you can get virtually any book you want instantly, and often cheaper than buying it in print. The second reason is the Kobo is so light in hand; it\u0026rsquo;s very comfortable to read on it. The third reason is that I like my font size to be a bit bigger than the average paperback novel, and ebooks allow you to adjust the font size to your liking.\nAll in all, I\u0026rsquo;ve drunk the ebook kool-aid.\nInitially, I thought the Kobo\u0026rsquo;s support for transferring your own epub files was a big plus. However, it turns out I rarely sideload epubs because very few publishers sell DRM free downloads of their books. Instead, you have to buy it through an online store, such as Kobo, Amazon, Google Books or Apple Books. Once you buy a book through a store, you can only read it on one of their apps or devices. So buyer beware, you\u0026rsquo;re Kobo books can only be read on a Kobo or via the Kobo app.\n Reading a print book still brings me a lot of pleasure, and it's nice to mix things up once in a while.  At this point, you might ask: why not simply read ebooks on my iPad? Ebook readers such as the Kobo and Kindle use a unique e-ink screen, mimicking actual paper. An iPad emits light out towards your eye. An e-ink screen requires light to shine onto it — just like real paper. Yes, they have screen lights, but these are designed to imitate a reading lamp rather than an eye-burning LCD.\nOccasionally, I do go back to a print book. For example, I found a secondhand copy of Peter F. Hamilton\u0026rsquo;s Pandora\u0026rsquo;s Star. There is something very satisfying about digging into a weighty tome, feeling the physical pages turn on an epic adventure. Also, I like having a bookshelf. It\u0026rsquo;s lovely to see a shelf or two packed with books. And since my library has a better print collection than ebook collection, I will sometimes borrow a physical book.\nReading a print book still brings me a lot of pleasure, and it\u0026rsquo;s nice to mix things up once in a while. However, there is one other significant advantage the Kobo has. I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading my way through the Star Trek line of post-Nemesis books — and it would be virtually impossible to get all those books in print form. I\u0026rsquo;d have to buy them secondhand from overseas, and some of them are now quite rare and therefore sell for $100+. Even the more modestly price copies sell for about $20, whereas the Kobo store sells them usually for $6 - $7. Given the price difference, read ten books and the Kobo has paid for itself.\nThere you have it. I\u0026rsquo;m a convert. I\u0026rsquo;m an ebook/Kobo evangelist.

It had been recommended to me by a friend, and I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest here — I found The Eye of the World to be a painfully dull read. It was slow, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t connect with any of the characters. I forced myself to the halfway point and then gave up.\nFrom here be spoilers!\nWhen Amazon announced their TV adaption, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly excited. However, my wife and I watched the first episode on a whim, and we were both pleasantly surprised. The costume design and set design both looked great. There was plenty of action, and Rosamund Pike ruled the screen as the powerful Aes Sedai character Moiraine Damodred. Daniel Henney also stood out, playing the laconic Lan Mandragoran.\nSo far, so good.\nThe rest of the cast was\u0026hellip; okay. Perrin and Rand came across as a little dull, and Nynaeve a little annoying. The best of the rest was Barney Harris as Mat Cauthon — and if you\u0026rsquo;ve watched the show, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably realised that he quit partway through the production. Thus, Mat Cauthon was temporarily written out of season 1, so it could be recast.\nOnline, I came across plenty of people moaning and groaning about the show being too woke.\n WOKE: is aware of and actively attentive to important facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice).\n Yes, many of the cast aren\u0026rsquo;t white. But seriously, the show was a lot less woke than people online would have you believe. The powerful Aes Sedai are all women, just as they were in the books. Some of the characters probably weren\u0026rsquo;t black or brown in the books — but it\u0026rsquo;s 2022. Who cares if they cast an actor that looks slightly different from the book\u0026rsquo;s descriptions — it\u0026rsquo;s not a lookalike contest.\nSome critics labelled it \u0026ldquo;The Woke of Time\u0026rdquo;, including renowned author Neal Asher.\nYikes. Who knew Neal was a middle-aged white guy who likes to complain about there not being enough white people on the small screen?\nAnyway, I hadn\u0026rsquo;t intended this review to focus too much on the wokiness, other than to say it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as crazily over-the-top woke as I expected. So yeah, that aspect didn\u0026rsquo;t spoil anything for me.\nThe show continued for a decent 5-6 episodes. It was action-packed, perhaps going a little too fast sometimes. Some episodes felt like they\u0026rsquo;d been rushed out the door — particularly the special effects behind The White Tower, which looked like they\u0026rsquo;d been built using a computer game graphics engine from 2007. I can imagine Jeff Bezos breathing down the VFX team\u0026rsquo;s neck: Faster! Cheaper! Outsource this to a third world country already!\nI recall from the first book (which I half read) that there is no question around who the chosen one is. It\u0026rsquo;s Rand, right from the start. They tried to up the suspense by keeping it a secret in the show. Is the chosen one Rand, Mat, Nyneave, Egwene or Perrin?\nThings start to unravel in the last couple of episodes. When they reveal the chosen one, Rand hears the whispers of the wind say to him: \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s you! Mwa ha ha!!\u0026rdquo; And suddenly, he knows what he\u0026rsquo;s always known\u0026hellip; or something like that. Meanwhile, a bunch of channelers unleash a massive lightning bolt that takes out an entire army, basically meaning any random bunch of Aes Sedai could be the most powerfully destructive force on the land. So who cares if the trollocs are coming?\nRand and Moraine travel through the Blight, and there they meet the big bad, who tempts Rand into constructing a fake but perfect life for himself. Of course, he rejects it, as the bad guy is bested. But it turns out the big bad is not the big bad — queue season 2.\nA little bit like Star Trek: Picard, The Wheel of Time has an excellent very good set-up, only to be let down by the last couple of episodes. When you construct story promises and build towards them, you also need to understand how you will deliver on those promises. I spent much of the show on the fence, not sure if I liked it or not. By the end, it simply felt unsatisfying.\nWill I watch season 2? Probably.\n","summary":"Many years ago, I tried to read the first The Wheel of Time instalment.

He’s got some bad news — his granddaughter Nemi has gotten into some strife, and he’s calling in a favour. In trying to find and help Nemi, Dax finds herself on Trill, embroiled in crime, politics, coverups and hidden agendas.\nFull review: spoilers ahead.\nFull disclosure — I am not a huge Deep Space 9 fan. I’ve watched it in its entirety, and although I can appreciate it, I just never loved it. Also, this is the first proper DS9 tie-in novel I’ve read, although other books I\u0026rsquo;ve recently reviewed such as Star Trek: Destiny and Typhon Pact: Zero Sum Game do incorporate characters from our favourite space station.\nBut I’m not the only one wading into uncharted waters. This is author Alex White\u0026rsquo;s first Star Trek book. They mentioned in an interview feeling a certain amount of pressure to “get Trek right”. Some folks take their Trek pretty seriously, and I could imagine the pressure they felt to deliver.\nThe first thing that attracted me to the book was the beautiful front cover. I rarely comment on book covers, but this was a real knockout. I haven’t been able to find the cover artist’s name online, but whoever you are — you did an excellent job.\nRevenant focuses on DS9 regular Jadzia Dax, and most of the book is set on Trill. It strikes a pretty good balance between original characters (Etom Prit, Nemi, Elta Vess) and characters from the show (Kira, Bashir, Worf). I’ve said before one of the cardinal sins of tie-in fiction is spending too much time with secondary, original characters and not enough time with characters we know and love from the small screen. But here, Alex White does a decent job.\nThe central theme of the story, I think, is one of regret and redemption. Dax has had a couple of rough past lives, and they come back to haunt her in this story. Her murderous former self, Joran, gets a little redemption — while Curzon is forced to face some of the regretful life choices he has made.\n The book’s best aspects come from exploring Jadzia’s relationships with her DS9 crew; Kira, Worf and Bashir.  At first, the book is something of a whodunnit. On Trill, to become joined with a symbiont is a big deal, and many candidates wash out of the gruelling process. Nemi was one such washout. However, it turns out Nemi is actually dead, and a rogue symbiont is controlling her mind and body. The main tension of the book is Dax and her mission to find out who \u0026ldquo;killed\u0026rdquo; her friend Nemi, since a symbiont has gained total control.\nAbout two-thirds way into the story, we learn that Elta Vess, a former lover of Curzon, had secretly been taking advantage of the symbiont washouts, offering them a chance to be joined. But in reality, she was cloning her symbiont self and joining with the washouts.\nI feel the twist was revealed a bit too early. For me, the tension released when we found out Vess was behind it all, and the final showdown felt a little tacked on. By the end, she’s simultaneously controlling hundreds of hosts and wreaking havoc. Not to say it was terrible, it just wasn’t quite the ending I thought I was going to get.\nThe book’s strongest aspects come from exploring Jadzia’s relationships with her DS9 crew; Kira, Worf and Bashir. They have plenty of good banter without it feeling too quippy or out of tune with the show. The book wastes no time exploring Dax’s feelings for Worf, which of course, plays out on screen from seasons four through six.\nRevenant is also noteworthy for being the second, recently published Star Trek book set within the timeframe of its respective TV show, rather than the post-Nemesis relaunch continuity. It was a refreshing change to simply be with the characters we know and love, rather than remembering which character is now on what ship and for what reason.\nAuthor Alex White spends considerable time describing fashion and food in their prose. Sumptuous, detailed descriptions of designer dresses, flowing gowns, sizzling meats and cold, crisp drinks fill the pages… which is a little weird because fashion and food aren’t a bit part of Trek. By that, I mean characters spend 97% of their time in a drab Starfleet uniform, and food is usually replicated rather than cooked. I suspect White has a personal interest in fashion — or maybe simply they enjoyed the idea of seeing Jadzia Dax a little dressed up.\nPersonally, as I’ve been writing these Star Trek book reviews, I’ve developed a set of golden rules for writing tie-in fiction. These are subject to change, of course — but they go like this:\n Thy shall not be boring Thy shall not have characters be inconsistent with the show Thy shall not overly focus on original characters  Alex White is a winner based on these golden rules: three for three. The book is full of action, mystery and fun character moments. White also displays a solid concept of the characters, and I could always match the actor’s voice to the book’s dialogue. And while the book did have quite a few original characters, the story stayed rooted with Jadzia Dax and her unique struggles.\nSomeone online posted that reading this book was, “[…] like getting a big warm hug from the DS9 crew.” That’s high praise. Perhaps if I were a bigger DS9 fan, I could feel the same. But I still had a great time reading the book, and I commend White for an excellent Trek debut.\nWhat did you think of Star Trek: Deep Space 9: Revenant? Let me know in the comments below.

Aventine escorts Julian Bashir and Sarina Douglas to the border of Breen space.\n 2382 — U.S.S. Aventine Seated in her ready room, Captain Ezri Dax counted the number of padds lined up on her desk. Sixteen. She pulled the first one from the top and read the screen: Due at 1600 hours: Captain’s report pertaining to the recent incursion along the Breen border. Starfleet priority order six.\nWith a sigh, Dax picked up the next padd on the desk. “Why can’t they consolidate these report requests into the same padd?” she asked, although no one was around to hear the question, much less answer it. Placing the device back down, she stood and took a moment to stretch. Her body felt like a collection of aching, knotted muscles loosely held together by skin and bone.\nThe Trill woman studied the interior of the captain’s ready room. Her ready room. A painting on the wall opposite caught her eye. It was a replicated copy of Picasso’s famous ‘Les Demoiselles d\u0026rsquo;Avignon’. Five nude human women, contorted and abstracted, stared fiercely back at her. It had belonged to Captain Dexar, the man who’d previously sat in Aventine’s big chair. She thought of him often. Aventine’s former Captain’s long shadow loomed throughout the ship’s decks.\nDuring the bloody conflict with the Borg, Dax had found herself the recipient of an unexpected field commission to captain. How many months had it been now since her promotion? Ten, or twelve, or fourteen — had Dax lost count?\nA low rumble rose from her stomach, and the tug of her body’s primal need for food pushed the morose thoughts aside. She approached the replicator and said, “Cottage pie and gravy, hot.” The dish whirled into existence. Dax picked up the plate and set it on her desk.\nAnother dinner alone, a padd in one hand and a fork in the other, she thought. And those five women in that ugly Picasso staring at me the whole time.\nThe desk-mounted terminal chimed, interrupting her meal. Dax tapped the keyboard a couple of times and pulled up the notification. It read: Holodeck time reminder: 1200 hours. Klingon calisthenics program. Duration: one hour.\nDuring these periods of relative quiet, the holodecks came under heavy use from the crew. But unless there was an emergency, she never missed her daily exercise regiment — Lieutenant Commander Worf’s infamous “Klingon calisthenics program.” As a starship captain, she needed to maintain her fitness and combat skills. But there was something else to it… she needed to feed the warrior inside of her. Dax was a person of peace, dedicated to peaceful exploration. But as captain of the Aventine, she needed to know that when the time came, she could be a warrior too.\nOne hour per day, sweat pouring down her face, heart pounding. And at least a couple of bruises.\nThe pile of unfinished and overdue reports stared at her from her desk. The responsible thing to do would be to sit down and finish those damned things, one by one. Starfleet H.Q. didn’t like it when they were sent late or if they were light on detail. Dax picked up a padd and studied it for a moment. Then she looked at the door.\nI need some excitement in my life.\nAfter quickly gobbling down a bit of cottage pie and changing clothes, she headed to the turbolift and then down to holodeck 4. Her step lightened as she strode along the corridor, but when she reached the doors, she stopped short. It was taken.\n Dax was a person of peace, dedicated to peaceful exploration. But as captain of the Aventine, she needed to know that when the time came, she could be a warrior too.  One of the few perks of being a starship captain is that people generally didn’t try to pinch your holodeck time. She placed her hands on her hips and huffed. “Computer, please tell me who is rude enough to be currently using holodeck 4? I might have some crew demotions to give out.”\nThe ship’s computer answered, “Holodeck 4 is currently occupied by Commander Bowers, Lieutenant Leishman, Doctor Tarses, Lieutenant Commander Helkara, Lieutenant Kedair, Ensigns Hockney and Riordan…”\n“Computer, stop reading out names,” she said. The computer silenced itself.\nThe entire senior staff are all on the holodeck… without me.\nDax felt her heart sinking into her stomach. Here she was, neck-deep in reports and Starfleet red-tape, seeking only a single hour for herself — and the entire senior staff were on the holodeck, having fun. She checked the name of the program: Bowers_gettogether_1\nHer hands formed a fist. Sucking in a deep breath, Dax tried to release the tension curdling throughout her body. It would seem that no one wanted to hang out with the captain. Then, she sighed and let it go. Dragging her feet on the regulation grey Starfleet carpet, she started the long walk back to the turbolift.\nFrom behind, she heard the dull hiss of doors opening. Turning, Dax saw Commander Sam Bowers, her X.O. and friend — or so she thought — coming towards her.\n“Captain,” he said, his eyes not quite meeting hers. “Aren’t you coming in for your regular fitness class? What is it again? Worf’s Killer Klingon Cage Fight or something?”\nDax forced a smile. “I was, but when the sign says occupied, it’s usually best not to enter.”\n“We were just finishing up,” Sam said. A smile moved across his handsome, ebony face. “All this business with the Borg and now the Typhon Pact… Some of us are just blowing off a little steam.”\nDax folded her arms. “Sam, how about this? You guys can extend your steam-blowing session for an extra hour. I’ve got a hundred reports due, all of them annoying.”\n“There will always be reports that need doing. Heck, I’m neglecting a couple of reports myself right now.”\n“Listen, I know you’re trying to be the nice guy. But I get it. It’s no fun having the Captain at the cards table, because suddenly no one wants to bet against her in case they win. It feels like the day before yesterday, I was nothing more than a ship’s counsellor, lieutenant junior grade. I’m still adjusting to my new role.”\nSam pinched his eyebrows together. “Really, please join us. It’s a very informal, fun little thing on the holodeck. Come for five minutes.”\nDax made a face.\n“Come for two minutes?”\n“I don’t want to be a third wheel,” Dax said. “Or eighteenth wheel, judging by the number of people already in holodeck 4.”\n“Come on, please? For me?”\nDax felt her shoulders hunch tight, and then relax. What was the point in arguing? “Sure,” she said.\nSam proffered a toothy smile and led the way. Walking side by side, Dax wondered if Sam might be up to something… The doors to the holodeck slid open, and a dozen people jumped in the air and yelled, “Surprise!”\nIn a split second, a breath caught in Dax’s throat. A huge white banner with bright red letters hung from the artificial ceiling. It read: Happy Anniversary Captain. Balloons floated on strings, and a long table topped with bottled champagne stood before her.\nDax placed a hand on her chest. “I think giving the captain a heart attack is a serious offence.”\nSam placed a hand on her arm. “It’s been one year since you took command of this vessel. And Captain, I think I speak for everyone here when I say, it’s been an honour and a privilege.”\nLennoc Keddair walked over, a bottle of champagne in one hand and a fluted glass in the other. She poured Dax a drink and said, “Here is to many more years.”\n“Cheers!” everyone said in unison.\nClapping and laughter filled the room. One by one, each person came around to congratulate her. A whole year since that awful day, when her former captain and X.O. were killed in action. During that time, the Borg were everywhere. Death was everywhere.\nTo think something as beautiful as this could grow from terror and tragedy.\nFor a moment, she wondered if it were appropriate to be celebrating, considering the circumstances of her promotion. But all those happy smiles on all those lovely faces… They need this just as much as I do, she thought. Perhaps more. We need to celebrate life. We need to live.\nAs Dax took a long sip of her champagne, the music kicked in.\n***\nSometime later, two or three hours perhaps, Ezri Dax found herself back in that dimly-lit ready room. She collapsed into her chair and was, once again, alone. Nothing but a pile of padds and overdue reports for company. Luckily they’d only knocked back a few glasses of synthehol, so her mind was quick to refocus.\nDax picked up a padd and looked up. There they were. Picasso’s five nude women, twisted and transfigured, strange in their hollowness — as if the artist had stripped away all their love and humanity. She could appreciate the genius of Earth’s famous Picasso. But that didn’t mean she had to like it.\nWith steady hands, she lifted the painting from its hook and placed it behind the small blue couch. She let out a long breath and said to the room, “Sorry, Captain Dexar, but I don’t much care for your taste in art.”\n","summary":" Historian’s note: This story takes place just after the events depicted in Typhon Pact #1: Zero Sum Game, in which Captain Dax and the U.S.S.

Niven \u0026amp; Pournelle write big books; the kind of books that would make an effective doorstop for even the heaviest of doors in the windiest of cities. Footfall, featuring dozens of characters and multiple, interweaving storylines, feels a lot like an epic movie. It\u0026rsquo;s hard not to compare it to the Roland Emerich school of storytelling; Indendepence Day in particular feels heavily influenced by Footfall.\nPerhaps the weirdest aspect of the book is that the aliens themselves are a sentient herd of small elephants. In that, their society has evolved around the idea of a herd, and herd mentality. As they begin their conquering campaign of Earth, the aliens struggle to understand humanity\u0026rsquo;s individualism. When a single human person acts out, contradicting the status quo, they declare them \u0026ldquo;insane.\u0026rdquo;\nSpeaking of insane; there is an insanely huge number of characters in the book. I\u0026rsquo;d guess at least a hundred named characters. My copy of the book had a list of the characters at the start, no doubt to help alleviate reader confusion. The list was so long I often had trouble finding a name on there.\nA common criticism of Footfall is that we are introduced to many characters at the beginning of the novel that, by the end, have no real concrete impact on the story. Certain characters get some heavy coverage early on, and then fade out three-quarters in.\nSome of the characters, particularly the female characters, feel woefully out of touch with today\u0026rsquo;s ideals. The book feels very 80s in the way it handles relationships. It seems everyone is sleeping with everyone else; again, some of these details have no impact on the overall story.\nThe main characters eventually take control of the narrative. There is Hairy Red, a down-on-his-luck biker and acoustic guitar enthusiast. David Coffey, the American president who doesn\u0026rsquo;t always make a convincing commander in chief. Jenny Crichton, an army captain who stumbles upon the discovery of the alien ship. Jack Clybourne, the presidential bodyguard and Jenny\u0026rsquo;s love interest\u0026hellip; hey, you know what? There are too many characters in this book to list even the main ones.\nFootfall has a long first act. The first act is probably the size of a small novel. As the aliens approach, a small ship is sent out to meet the approaching ship. Lots of stuff happens on Earth. Space nut Wes Dawson maneuvers his way onto the ship as Earth\u0026rsquo;s resident American politician.\nThere were a glut of disaster and alien invasion movies in the 90s and 2000s (Independence Day, 2012, The Day After Tomorrow, and so on), all of which seem to draw influence from Footfall. The book switches perspectives often, using a large cast of characters to show the huge event from several different perspectives.\nReading the book, I mentally cast American president David Coffey as Bill Pullman. However, unlike President Thomas J. Whitmore, Coffey is less sure of himself and fails to deliver any memorable speeches.\nNormally, I don\u0026rsquo;t particularly like books that change perspectives regularly, preferring a narrative anchored to a single character. However, Footfall showed me just how effective a large cast can be. Perhaps, because each of the cast of characters is securely tied to the overall plot of imminent invasion, they each, in their way keep the main story chugging along.\nPeople will criticise the book for being a bit behind the times. Pournelle is well-known to have conservative political opinions, some of which seep into the book. It\u0026rsquo;s not an optimistic Star Trek type story. Nor is it especially dark or grim. The tone works well because it strikes a good balance, even if some of the interpersonal aspects feel a bit 80s.\nSpeaking of the 80s\u0026hellip; probably my least favourite part of the book was the scenes involving the political machinations of the Soviet Union. Perhaps in a different time, this would have been more appealing. But mostly it feels like a diversion from the main story.\nThe aliens themselves are fascinating, and the book focuses on them and their complex culture more than I expected. They are not the featureless black evil beasts from Alien or Independence Day. Instead, the Fithp are a herd of sentient baby elephants armed with a technology they barely understand.\nMy biggest issue with the alien characters was that it was difficult to keep track of which character was which. With so many different fithp interacting on the ship, mostly without any distinct characteristics, it got a bit confusing. I think the book should have focused on one central alien character. This might have helped them feel more grounded.\n A few minor quibbles aside, Footfall was just so much fun to read  That being said, the alien that surrenders to the Earthlings and helps Coffey and his team of sci-fi writer advisors was a masterstroke and provided many funny scenes. Who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t giggle at the idea of the American president climbing into a warm mudbath to get some information from a sympathetic alien baby elephant?\nA few minor quibbles aside, Footfall was just so much fun to read. It made me realise alien invasion stories such as these are surprisingly rare in book form. I cannot think of another similar example. At times it feels like a Michael Crichton or Stephen King book. However, I liked it more than both Jurassic Park or The Stand, for example.\nFootfall has turned me into a huge Pournelle and Niven fan. I\u0026rsquo;ve already since read The Mote In God\u0026rsquo;s Eye and soon I will also read Lucifer\u0026rsquo;s Hammer. It\u0026rsquo;s truly epic, massive sci-fi. I only wish it was easy to find books this good more often.\n","summary":"Written in 1985, Footfall is an epic story of alien invasion.

From Caretaker to Endgame, it was quite a journey through the delta quadrant. Now, 20 years since the series finale, I have a few thoughts I\u0026rsquo;d like to share.\nThe Journey Begins I have a bit of a mixed history with Voyager. I watched the show when it first aired. Here in Australia, it aired every Thursday, 11pm, on Channel 9. I was just 12-13 years old, when I watched the premier double episode, Caretaker. Until that point, I\u0026rsquo;d been a casual, newish fan of The Original Series, which I liked mainly for its fun, retro aesthetic and creative plotlines.\nVoyager was the new, shiny Trek. Each Thursday night, I\u0026rsquo;d set the VCR to time-record the show on VHS tape. As the show continued on, I missed a few episodes here and there. I watched a fair bit of it, but never saw it through to the end. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure it was just my tumultuous teenage years getting int the way, or if Channel 9 stopped airing the show. Either way, Voyager was an unfinished chapter for me. I never knew if or how the crew made their way home.\nMany years later, as a casual Trek fan, I discovered The Next Generation. Despite the shaky first couple of seasons, I grew to like, then really like, then love the show. TNG remains for me the pinnacle of Trek. At its best, TNG was in a league of its own.\nOnce TNG ended, I had a starship sized hole in my life. I watched most of Deep Space 9, but struggled to click with the show (to this day it remains my least favourite Trek). Then I moved onto Voyager. The first double episode, although not perfect, was still a cracker, and kicked things off in a big way. Stranded 75 light years from home, in an unexplored region of the Galaxy, this ragtag group of Starfleet personnel and Marqui rebels would have to work together to find their way home.\n\u0026hellip; and so, the most common criticism of Voyager laid itself bare before my eyes. Many people complain that the show failed to fulfil its premise. Just a few episodes in, everyone is getting along just fine. The Marqui rebels are now part of the crew. Edgy characters find their edges filed down to a smooth curve. Rick Berman, the infamous produce of Voyager, famously stated that audiences would soon tire of an intra-ship conflict between the two sides. Translation: Hit the status quo early and start churning out some seriously vanilla Trek.\nThe show quickly settles into monster-of-the-week storytelling. Fans bemoaned the show\u0026rsquo;s tendency to re-use elements from The Next Generation. \u0026ldquo;Recycled storylines\u0026rdquo; is a common criticism. But what I found more annoying for the subtler similarities in character. For instance, The Doctor is obviously Voyager\u0026rsquo;s Data. Two artificial intelligences striving to be more human. But where Data plays classical violin, The Doctor sings opera. Wow, so different! Similarly, where Captain Picard likes to drink plenty of \u0026ldquo;Tea, earl grey, hot\u0026rdquo; — Captain Janeway drinks black coffee. Wow, so different!\nBeginning, Middle and End Novelist Brandon Sanderson, in his excellent lecture series on storytelling, breaks the three act structure of a story into three major areas: Promises, Progress and Payoff. Using this as a framework, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see why Voyager struggled to keep a strong audience.\nPromises Voyager started off by offering its audience an exciting set of promises. The Caretaker thrusts two warring sides, Starfleet and Marqui, into the delta quadrant. They must work through their differences to find a way home. It sounds cool, right? Except, the show then breaks this promise. As mentioned above, within just a few episodes one can\u0026rsquo;t tell a Marqui from Starfleet. Characters like Tom Paris and B\u0026rsquo;elanna are promised to be edgy, intransigent characters. Instead, Tom becomes a cuddly teddy bear and B\u0026rsquo;elanna, half Klingon, barely raised her voice even once.\nProgress Sanderson states that the middle act of a story should show the characters progressing towards their goal, as they overcome various challenges along the way. The key is progress. Obviously, Voyager was churning out 25 episodes per season, so not every episode was going to advance their journey back to Earth significantly. But Voyager has virtually no sense of real, meaningful progress. Yes, occasionally an episode will end with Janeway sipping a cup of black coffee, giving her Captain\u0026rsquo;s Log and saying, \u0026ldquo;But at least we managed get cut a few years of our journey\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; But none of these minor wins result in them getting anywhere near Earth by season 7. Never, at any point, does the audience feel a genuine sense of progress. It\u0026rsquo;s monster-of-the-week, every week. Although both its predecessor, Deep Space 9, and its successor, Enterprise, both featured heavily serialised storylines in their later seasons, Voyager thoroughly eschewed the idea of serialisation.\nPayoff Despite some criticisms, Voyager had a decent double-episode finale. Endgame had it all: a promise to get back home, a price to pay, a chance to deal serious damage to the Borg\u0026hellip; and of course that old Trek favourite; time travel. But with a set of broken promises and no sense of progress, the finale feels rushed and tacked on. Seven years, hundreds of crazy adventures, and then: \u0026ldquo;Whoah hey look a wormhole back home. Too bad it\u0026rsquo;s filled with Borg\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Watching the last season, I remember watching the second last episode of Voyager ever, and thinking to myself: \u0026ldquo;They are still in the f****** delta quadrant\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Re-watch 1\u0026amp;2 After watching The Next Generation, I struggled with Voyager. Half way into season 1, I gave up. But recently I gave the show another go, picking up where I left off. Slowly, slowly\u0026hellip; the show wormed its way into my heart. In order to enjoy the show, one must simply accept that it is 100% a monster-of-the-week show. It is not a show about a crew working together to find a way home. The show is about a diverse group of folks encountering a bunch of crazy delta quadrant aliens and having a bunch of wacky adventures. One must disregard to promises, forgive the lack of progress, and enjoy it for what it is.\nThere are some nice, continuous aspects to the show. Watching Naomi Wildman get born, and then grow up on the ship, is oddly satisfying. Seven and The Doctor have decent character arcs, particularly in the later seasons. The Tom/B\u0026rsquo;elanna romance was a stroke of genius; we even see them get married and have a child. The show\u0026rsquo;s subplots, if that\u0026rsquo;s the right term, are actually more consistently serialised than TNG. It\u0026rsquo;s the main plot that gets stuck in the weekly rut.\nA Tale Of Two Voyagers There is a marked different in Voyager between its first three seasons, and season four onwards. At season 4, the show suddenly feels more settled, and more consistent. It\u0026rsquo;s funnier, even. A lot of what we think of as Voyager\u0026rsquo;s major plot points start at season 4. The Tom/B\u0026rsquo;elanna romance is introduced. The Harry Kim/Tom Paris bromance is solidified. And of course, Seven of Nine is brought in — which kicks off her friendship with The Doctor and her tumultuous relationship with Captain Janeway.\nBut the first three seasons, for me, offer a kind of goofy, sentimental satisfaction. Neelix and Kes feature heavily in the earlier episodes — and although neither character was a fan favourite, I always found them to be entertaining to watch. Indeed, I was sad when they gave Kes the boot to make way for Seven. There were plenty of excellent episodes: Future\u0026rsquo;s End, Deadlock and Death Wish come to mind as real standouts.\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to deny the show gets better in season 4. It\u0026rsquo;s as if the show\u0026rsquo;s writers finally settled on where the characters needed to be. The show leans a bit too much on the Borg, sure, and sometimes it feels like \u0026ldquo;The Seven of Nine Show: featuring the Starship Voyager\u0026rdquo;. And if you hope, by the later seasons, you will see some genuine progress in their journey back to earth\u0026hellip; well\u0026hellip;\nHow I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Once I accepted Voyager was an imperfect, wildly inconsistent, occasionally derivative, monster-of-the-week show — I had a great time watching it. In an age of complicated, violent, serialised tv shows, it was nice to watch family friendly, self-contained stories. I could watch an episode here or there without feeling an urge to go crazy and binge. I could watch it while I was cooking. I could watch an episode while I ate lunch, my dog Charlie snoozing on the couch beside me.\nVoyager has a lot of strong points that are sometimes overlooked. The cast is exceptional, and every actor brings their A-game to the set, and does their absolute best even when the material isn\u0026rsquo;t perfect. Kate Mulgrew shines as Captain Janeway. The show took surprising risks, often launching an episode on an alien world with a set of unfamiliar faces — as slowly the connection back to Voyager was revealed. Tuvok delivers some hilarious lines. Harry and Tom are a crack up with their Captain Proton holodeck adventures. At its best, Voyager was uniquely charming and so much fun to watch. At its worst, it was often still goofy and fun.\nIf you want to love Voyager, you simply have to accept it for what it is. Is it as good as TNG? For me, no. But that\u0026rsquo;s not really the point. Because it is, ultimately, its own show. It\u0026rsquo;s no wonder the show has had a real resurgence of late. Thanks to Netflix and Paramount+, fans are rediscovering the show or watching it for the first time. It was the last of its kind. TNG, DS9 and VOY are all birds of a feather. But for me, Voyager will always remind me of that 13-year-old boy, setting up his VCR to record the show; the boy who couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait to find out what this week\u0026rsquo;s adventure would be.\n","summary":"Recently, I did a re-watch of Star Trek: Voyager.

Confused by all the terms: Relaunch, litverse, post-Nemesis continuity? Not sure where and how to start with Treklit? This article is a simple explainer.\nThere are a lot of Trek books. And I mean, a lot. For many years, Trek novels were simply original works of fiction, based on the show (TOS, TNG etc). They were self-contained books, and set during the TV series. Sometimes they\u0026rsquo;d even say: \u0026ldquo;The following story takes place shortly after episode X\u0026rdquo;. CBS marketing, or whoever owned Star Trek at the time, signed off on each book to ensure the books wouldn\u0026rsquo;t contradict the show; past, present or future.\nBut, by the mid-2000s, the Star Trek franchise was dead in the water. Star Trek: Nemesis had bombed at the cinema. They cancelled Star Trek: Enterprise after just 4 seasons. Deep Space 9 and Voyager had finished up their run, and no further sequels, movies or spinoffs were planned.\nAt this time, CBS marketing (or whoever) loosened their guidelines around Trek books. For the first time, the books could now continue the events of the TV series after its last episode or movie. E.g. If you have ever wanted to know what happened after Voyager made it back to earth, you can read: Star Trek: Voyager: Homecoming. The book is set immediately after the series finale, Endgame, and continues the story. The next book continued on from that book, and so on.\n Deep Space 9:  The books \u0026ldquo;Avatar Part 1 \u0026amp; 2\u0026rdquo;, published in 2001, continue the story after the DS9 series finale.   Voyager  The books \u0026ldquo;Homecoming\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The Farther Shore\u0026rdquo;, published in 2003, continue the story after the VOY series finale.    Things get a bit more complicated, though. In 2005, it was time for Star Trek: The Next Generation to get to the relaunch treatment. The first TNG relaunch title was Death in Winter, published in 2005. However, in the same year, they also published Star Trek: Titan: Taking Wing, which was a TNG spinoff, in which Riker is now a captain on the USS Titan (referenced in the movie Nemesis), alongside Troi and Tuvok.\nBoth book series would run in parallel, existing in a shared universe. Voyager and Deep Space 9 were still continuing their \u0026ldquo;relaunch\u0026rdquo; stories independently. But, of course, all three series were chronologically taking place simultaneously, in the same universe.\nEventually, Voyager and Deep Space 9\u0026rsquo;s relaunch books were \u0026ldquo;merged\u0026rdquo; into the shared universe set up by TNG and Titan. There were additional spin-offs and crossovers that were set in this \u0026ldquo;litverse\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;post-Nemesis shared continuity\u0026rdquo;. These include one-shot books such as Star Trek: Articles of the Federation and Star Trek: A Singular Destiny. Also, Star Trek: Department of Temporal Investigations and Star Trek: Section 31.\nConfused yet? The hardest part is finding out some kind of logical order in which to read them. Luckily, there are two outstanding resources online.\nIf you just want a dead-simple list to follow, with a list of books set out in a sensible order, check out: https://startreklitverse.com/simple-post-nemesis-reading-list.php\nHowever, as I\u0026rsquo;ve read along with a dozen books, it\u0026rsquo;s become obvious that there is no exact order in which we must read them. Many books run roughly parallel to each other and have fairly independent stories. If you prefer to pick and choose a bit, while following a sensible reading order, I recommend: https://www.shastrix.com/books/star-trek-reading-order.php\nOf course, this line of books does not nicely match up to the new Star Trek: Picard. So if you read these books, understand that they are one possible timeline of events. That being said, the last three books in the series, a trilogy named Coda, may tie up the loose ends somehow.\nThe last thing I will say is kudos to the Star Trek publishers Simon \u0026amp; Schuster / Pocket Books for giving the writers a chance to wrap up the post-Nemesis relaunch/litverse book series. Star Wars tie-in lit was in a similar position, and Disney just cut the book series, without a satisfying resolution, once the new movies came out. So good on them for giving readers a proper ending!\n","summary":"Confused about all the Star Trek books? Confused by all the terms: Relaunch, litverse, post-Nemesis continuity?

Zahn is the author of the Quadrail books, the three Cobra trilogies and more recently the Sybils War trilogy. However, he is perhaps best known for his Star Wars tie-in novel series Heir To The Empire.\nSpoilers ahead!\nReview Ghost Riders In The Sky focuses on the character of Skoda, a misanthropic, down-and-out \u0026rsquo;navigator\u0026rsquo;. He likes a drink (or three), and doesn’t think too highly of people; be they human or Meerian.\nThe Meerians control space travel, using humans to navigate their ships by having them sit in a Sue Ann Chair and project themselves out beyond the starship’s bow using a kind of astral projection. This takes a heavy toll on the poor human navigators, who must endure a 10-year indenture if they’re silly enough to sign up for flight school.\nSkoda is approached by a group of humans intent on breaking the Meerian’s monopoly on space flight. However, their actions catch the attention of those who have an interest in maintaining the status quo. Meanwhile, the mysterious stargulls start showing up every time Skoda takes a trip into space, and before long he learns the secret behind their existence.\nI immediately liked Skoda, the book’s protagonist. He’s grouchy, misanthropic, and burnt out from his many years as an indentured navigator. When he is approached by Chandra and co, he’s instantly suspicious and standoffish, in the classic style of the reluctant hero. But he’s fed up with Merrian control, so he realises there is value in their risky proposal.\n Zahn's writing style is, as always, punchy and concise. He doesn't spend much time building up backstories or describing things in great detail.  If you have read Zahn’s Quadrail books, you might have noticed similarities between Skoda and the hero of the Quadrail novels, Frank Compton. They’re both guys who are a bit down on their luck, not particularly heroic, and generally fly by the seat of their pants.\nZahn’s writing style is, as always, punchy and concise. He doesn’t spend much time building up backstories or describing things in great detail. Zahn focuses on a fast-paced plot, with plenty of action and a bit of mystery. When reading Ghost Riders I envisioned a Blade Runner-esque world; dirty cities filled with huge technicolour advertisements, plumes of bilious smoke choking the air, and the soft hiss of acid rain burning the steaming streets. Of course, Zahn describes nothing in this way. But for me, the book gave off a cyberpunk vibe.\nAs the story progresses, it focuses more on the mysterious stargulls. As it turns out, they are the male ghosts of another race who had once acted as navigators. However, they had rebelled against the Merrian’s and wound up perpetually stuck on the astral plane while their females were locked up in status capsules.\nNothing about Ghost Riders In The Sky is particularly groundbreaking or inventive. But it’s a solid and enjoyable story, which I devoured in just a few sittings. We get a fascinating glimpse into a futuristic world; a world Zahn could potentially explore again. I also liked the cover art, which skillfully illustrated a navigator projected out in front of a starship.\n","summary":"In 2020, veteran sci-fi author Timothy Zahn dipped his toes into self-publishing for the first time, releasing the original novella Ghost Riders In The Sky.
