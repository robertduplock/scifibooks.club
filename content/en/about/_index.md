---
Sci-Fi Books Club is a site dedicated to reviewing science fiction books. We're Trekkies, Dune-ies (is that a thing?) and generally prefer the pulpy, B-grade science fiction books. All books receive a fair and honest review â€” however, all opinions are just our own and all reviews should be taken with a grain of ~~salt~~ melange.

Keep an eye out in the future for more book reviews, interviews and blog posts.

### Send us something

We happily accept books for review (epub format please). However, if you do send us your book, we _cannot_ guarantee a review. Just send us a note on the [contact form](Contact Us "/contact"), or shoot it straight through to <sorry-email-obscured-to-prevent-span>

We also happily accept freelance book reviews, as long as you are in no way associated with the author of the book. Again, we can't guarantee your review will be published.
