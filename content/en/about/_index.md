---
Sci-Fi Books Club is a site dedicated to reviewing science fiction books. We're Trekkies, Dune-ies (is that a thing?) and generally prefer pulpy, B-grade science fiction books (although we _did_ review Asimov's Foundation, so...) 

All books receive a fair and honest review, all opinions are our own and all reviews should be taken with a grain of ~~melange~~ salt.

Keep an eye out in the future for more science fiction book reviews, author interviews and blog posts.

### Send us something

We happily accept books for review (epub format please). Just send us a note on the [contact form](/contact) and we'll share out contact details.
