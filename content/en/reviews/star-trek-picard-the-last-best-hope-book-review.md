Author Una McCormack wrote the first tie-in novel for Star Trek: Picard. One could only imagine the amount of pressure she must have felt to get it right. _Star Trek: Picard: The Last Best Hope_ is the prequel to the TV series and tells the story of how to plan to evacuate Romulus went so wrong.

For the record, I am a Picard fan. I decided to read _The Last Best Hope_ as I rewatched season 1 in preparation for the upcoming season 2. I acknowledge Picard had its faults (particularly in the last couple of episodes), and it is a much darker Trek than what we've had before. It's not everyone's cup of earl grey — but for me, it was a good show.

My wife said to me once, "Sometimes you pick up a book, read the first page, and you just know that you're in good hands." That's how I felt picking up this book. The first thing I noted was how lovingly to book was written. The prose is neat and clean, and the story is nicely paced — not too fast, not too slow.

The story goes like this: The Romulans, long time enemies of the Federation, are facing certain destruction as their sun is set to go supernova. Jean-Luc Picard, now an Admiral, leads a massive rescue effort. However, not everything thinks Starfleet should burn the candle at both ends, saving their old enemy — furthermore, they face resistance from the Romulans themselves. The Romulans have a longstanding culture of fear and paranoia, which gets in the way of the rescue mission.

If the book has a theme, I'd say the following quote (which is used in the book) just about encapsulates it.

> It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness. That is life.
>
>   _— Jean-Luc Picard_

The main story thread, in which Picard and his new XO Raffi Musiker, tirelessly trying to save as many Romulan lives as possible. The pair, and all those who help them, really do nothing wrong. Yes, they take some risks. But they never stuff it up. The mission is a failure due to a confluence of events out of their hands. And yet, the failure utterly wrecks their lives. I guess, reflecting on the above quote, they get a solid taste of _life_.

Una McCormack does a stellar job introducing Raffi and building her relationship with Picard. The mission wreaks havoc on Raffi's life, as she sacrifices her relationship with her husband and son to keep going, year after year, saving Romulan lives — even when they are less than grateful. 

This story creates an essential bridge between the optimistic Trek of yore and this newer, darker take. We learn that most people were, in fact, in favour of saving the Romulans. But as the rescue effort dragged out and the costs piled up, support waned. Opportunistic politicians such as Olivia Quest found a way to capitalise on anti-Romulan sentiment. And then the synths went rogue on Mars, which was the final nail in the coffin for the rescue effort.

Bringing Jordie La Forge into the story was a stroke of genius. I didn't know that his character would make an appearance, and the early scenes with him puzzling out the shipyard production issues were outstanding. It was a nice little bonus to have a character from The Next Generation TV series find his way into the book. 

My favourite subplot was the one that focused on Earth scientist and astronomer Doctor Amal Safadi and her Romulan counterpart Doctor Nokim Vritet. Safadi discovers that the Romulan sun is going supernova faster than expected, and the effects will be bigger than expected. However, she can't get this information corroborated by her counterpart, as the Romulan secret police (the Tal Shiar) keep getting in the way. The two characters never meet, and yet they feel connected. Vritet eventually goes full 1984 and buys into the Romulan propaganda, believing everything is fine. It's a horrible, tragic and yet profound moment in the story. 

Another plotline focuses on Agnes Juradi and Bruce Maddox. They create an army of non-sentient worker synths who populate the shipbuilding facility on Mars, churning out huge starships for the rescue effort. The _other_ other plotline focuses on Oliva Quest, who leads a campaign to have the rescue efforts reigned in. 

So many themes from today work their way effortlessly into the story. Brexit, for example, was nothing but a thinly veiled manifestation of anti-refugee sentiment in the UK. In this story, a Brexit-like campaign is carried out by Olivia Quest and her cronies. 

Other themes such as climate change, misinformation, the importance of independent media, and independent scientific research litter the pages. In many ways, McCormack wrestles with these big ideas better than the TV show — they're woven into the story by the very nature of the action and events, rather than feeling tacked on and preachy. 

Interestingly, the book isn't afraid to drop an f-bomb or two. There is quite a bit of coarse language in the book. Those of us who remember the nice, family-friendly Trek of the 80s and 90s might find this a bit jarring. But then, like all things, Trek must move with the times.
