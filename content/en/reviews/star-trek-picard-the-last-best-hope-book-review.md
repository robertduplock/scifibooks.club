Author Una McCormack was selected to write the first tie-in novel for Star Trek: Picard. One could only imagine the amount of pressure she must have felt to get it right. Star Trek: Picard: The Last Best Hope is the prequel to the TV series and tells the story of how to plan to evacuate Romulus went so wrong.
