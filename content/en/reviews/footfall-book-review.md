Written in 1985, _Footfall_ is an epic story of alien invasion. Niven & Pournelle write the kind of books that would make an effective doorstop for even the heaviest of doors in the windiest of cities. _Footfall,_ featuring dozens of characters and multiple, interweaving storylines, feels a lot like an epic movie. In fact, it's hard not to compare it to the Roland Emerich school of storytelling; Indendepence Day in particular feels heavily influenced by _Footfall_.

Perhaps the weirdest aspect of the book is that the aliens themselves are a sentient herd of small elephants. In that, their society has evolved around the idea of a herd, and herd mentality. As they begin their conquering campaign of Earth, the aliens struggle to understand humanity's individualism. When a single human person acts out, contradicting the status quo, they declare them "insane."

Speaking of insanse; there is an insansely huge number of characters in the book. I'd guess at least a hundred names characters. My copy of the book had a list of the characters at the start, no doubt to help alleviate reader confusion. The list was so long I often had trouble finding a name on there. 

A common criticism of Footfall is that we are introduced to many characters at the beginning of the novel that, by the end, have no real concrete impact on the story. Certain characters get some heavy coverage early on, and then fade out three-quarters in. 

Some of the characters, particularly the female characters, feel woefully out of touch with today's ideals. The book feels very 80s in the way it handles relationships. It seems everyone is sleeping with everyone else; again, some of these details have no impact on the overall story.

The main characters eventually take control of the narrative. There is Hairy Red, a down-on-his-luck biker and acoustic guiter enthusiast. David Coffey, the American president who doesn't always make a convincing commander in chief. ...

_Footfall_ has a long first act. In fact, the first act is probably the size of a small novel. A small ship is sent out
