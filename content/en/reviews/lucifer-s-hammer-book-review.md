The eeriest part of the story of the dinosaurs is its sudden, abrupt, and once-mysterious ending. After nearly 200 million years of domination, the dinosaurs vanished in a startlingly moment. Although the source of this mass extinction was debated hotly for years, today, a consensus of scientists believes asteroid impact to have been the culprit. The force of the impact shockwave would have been disastrous by itself, vaporizing everything in a wide radius...but the widespread ecological disruption and climate change that followed doomed the survivors, especially those who were adapted for particular environmental niches. Imagine, then, the fate of hyperspecialized humans following a similar impact. What becomes of us, a species most of whose members are far removed from the production of food, who are utterly dependent on an evermore fragile castle of cards called civilization, when that structure collapses? Such is the setup of the terrifying disaster thriller Lucifer’s Hammer, easily the best of its genre I have ever read...or can imagine.

_Lucifer’s Hammer_ is one of the classic works of science fiction; it was nominated for the Hugo and Locus awards for Best Novel. Written by Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven and published in 1977, _Lucifer’s Hammer_ is one of the most prominent examples of the post-apocalyptic trope of modern science fiction. Set primarily in California, the story follows a large cast of characters as they are affected by the discovery of the Hamner-Brown comet, its rapid approach to Earth, catastrophic collision and the immediate aftermath.

Lucifer’s Hammer falls into the “End of the World/Catastrophic Event/How Will the Human Race Survive” category. However, it can be further broken down into those niche genres in SF that wipe California off the face of the map then discuss how Earth will survive.  
  
Destruction of California aside, this was an excellent book. Tim Hamner discovers a comet, which upon further investigation, will be moving through Earths solar system in the near-immediate future. Chances of it hitting are a million to one…nope, better make that 100,000 to one. Oops! A slight miscalculation, 10,000 to one. Wrong again! 1000 to one. Oh, drat! It hit in 6 places!

The book’s first third establishes the characters and how people react to the news of impending doom. And there are a LOT of characters. Some don’t believe it; some go all out in their preparations, some wait till the very last day.  
  
The second third of the book deals with impact and the days immediately after blow: how giant tsunamis wipe out any coastal area, cities and islands; the force of impact drives seafloor mud and ocean water far into the atmosphere and rains down upon the land, causing huge flood events; mega-hurricanes are spawned affecting weather patterns over tremendous areas; earthquakes shake the continents and Russia, and China launch nuclear weapons at each other. It looks at how people respond both individually and as small groups. It gets a bit gruesome, but I like that look at reality.

  
The year is 1977, and the Cold War is about to end...for the participants are doomed. The discovery of a new comet delights the astronomical community and general public, especially seeing as it will pass near enough to the Earth to provide a fantastic light show but not too close to posing a threat. But no one’s data is perfect, and the comet -- dubbed The Hammer of Lucifer -- does fall. Multiple impact points vaporize land and ocean alike, and the force of the hit triggers massive earthquakes and global volcanic activity. Tsunamis and torrential rains follow, and the astronauts orbiting Earth can only watch in horror as chaos engulfs the globe, civilization goes dark. Finally, the Earth itself becomes clouded over -- no longer a ‘pale blue dot’, the planet is shrouded in storm clouds that will deliver a harvest-killing rain of destruction.

The story is set in the late 1970s, and the cultural assumptions and depictions are somewhat jarring as one views them from a gay, Black man living in the 21st century. This is not a new experience I (and am sure many other readers who are not in the expected target audience of straight, white males) have had reading alleged classics of science fiction. Honestly, I would say that _Lucifer’s Hammer_ has fewer “ugh!” moments than others I have read. (Looking at you, Robert A. Heinlein!) For example, the N-word does appear in the text, unexpurgated.  
  
On the ground, beneath those clouds, there are survivors. Those who live through Hammerfall race toward the high ground like rats fleeing a sinking ship. Once they were civilized, their shoulders bore a thousand petty burdens -- what to wear, which car to purchase next? -- but now they were reduced to scrounging for food and shelter. Rich and poor, powerful and weak, black and white -- no one is spared from the fundamental struggle of survival. As the weeks pass and the immediate damages are over, the scattered survivors form groups and learn that their greatest enemy may be one another, for the disaster’s fallout has allowed some of the most base and savage instincts of humanity to express themselves in full. Although readers get hints of what is happening worldwide, most of the action is confined to the San Joaquin Valley of California. As in Stephen King’s The Stand, the survivors coalesce into two groups, and their interests collide in the fate of a nuclear power plant that somehow survived the catastrophe and may represent humanity’s best hope for recovery.

The third part of the book speculates what people would do to survive how would they react to this new state of survival, and I have to say the authors did a pretty good job of touching on a bit of every part of humanity, the good, the bad and the gruesome.

The primary way the disconnect between the modern reader and the somewhat dated text manifests is in a lack of empathy for the primary characters. I was never that invested in whether a particular character that we’ve been given a first-person perspective of would survive or not. To me, the narrative tension in the book that kept me reading to the end was the recognizable plausibility of the depiction of the rapid deterioration of civilization after the cataclysmic comet collision and whether human society would still be viable at the end of the book. Pournelle & Niven use 3-4 main characters as devices through which they tell the story. The first is Tim Hamner, a wealthy astronomical amateur who happens to discover the comet and then escapes with a woman-who-is-not-his-wife to Northern California after devastating tidal waves inundate and decimate Southern California where he lives. Another is Harvey Randall, a producer of television documentaries who do a series of stories on Hamner and the comet. The third most prominent character is Maureen Jellison, daughter of U.S. Senator Arthur Clay Jellison. When the comet strikes, Jellison becomes the de facto leader of a group of survivors in Northern California due to his foresightedness to stockpile proper supplies on his ranch in the area. Many other characters also get first-person accounts, from the murderer-rapist who takes advantage of the turmoil and confusion to commit crimes to the policeman who punishes him and maintains law and order despite the uncertainty of whether humanity itself will persist and lastly, the Black criminal Alim Nassor who (unsuccessfully) attempts to use the abandonment of white folks their homes to enrich and empower himself and his “brothers.” Of course, some of these characters are bad people, so that’s one reason why it’s challenging to connect with them or care about their survival. However, some of the characters are not that relatable to me (perhaps because I’m not in the expected target audience). And, frankly, some of the depictions of the characters (or, more accurately, the characters’ attitudes and beliefs) are borderline offensive.

But I have a few complaints, mainly with the book's third part. This was written in the ’70s, and the 70’s attitude toward women was still prevalent. Women were to be protected subservient roles to the men (housewives who volunteered, secretaries, accountants, cooks). What got my goat was for a tiny group trying to survive; when the current leader died (predicted to happen anytime in the following “year”), the new leader of the valley would be determined by whomever his daughter married. Three guys were posturing for her “attention” while sneaking off to sleep with a fourth. Give me a break!  
  
The Hammer unleashes virtually every natural disaster known to us. Still, I was less interested in the race for immediate survival during the fall itself than in the aftermath. How do people survive the coming winter, let alone the coming ice age? Lucifer’s Hammer abounds in characters, and watching them struggle to regain civilization -- and collapse into depravity -- is utterly gripping. People are forced to assume leadership, to find a place for themselves in this newly devastated world. Death is all around them, and their futures are utterly uncertain. It’s an ideal foundation for a novel in which human beings struggle against the elements and the worst of themselves, seeking to overcome it all.

However, in the end, I would say that overall, _Lucifer’s Hammer_ is an effective, if flawed, entry in the genre of a speculative fictional depiction of apocalyptic events. It would have been improved by providing a more diverse set of perspectives on the cataclysmic events by including different characters.

This is one SF thriller I highly recommend; this makes the Mayan doomsday hype look pale by comparison.

It was also brought to my attention that blacks are stereotyped in this story as the poor inner-city types who continue to rob, pillage, and rape both before impact and after. The authors attempted to counter this by sending a black man into space and returning a hero, but his part is somewhat minor compared to the gangs roaming the countryside.  
  
Still, if one can put aside some of the quirks and if you like the end of the world type stories, this one was pretty darn good.
