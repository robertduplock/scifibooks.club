Humanity is about to go the way of the dinosaur. A mass extinction event is cruising through space. Its name is the Hamner/Brown comet. What will humanity do, when it's faced with the apocalypse? Water vaporised, endless salt-water rain, earthquakes...

Hide your kids, hide your wife. The comet is coming.

_Lucifer’s Hammer_ is a classic work of science fiction; nominated for the Hugo and Locus awards for Best Novel. The dynamic writing duo of Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven published it in 1977, and along with their similar novel Footfall, set the benchmark for end-of-the-world stories. A huge cast of characters, unconnected at first, are brought together by the comet and the havoc it wreaks.

The story starts with Richie Rich amateur astronomer Tim Hamner discovering a comet — but don't worry, the chances of it hitting earth are like a million to one. No wait, a thousand to one. No wait...

_Lucifer’s Hammer_ has a first act, in which we're introduced to a dizzying array of characters. The main members of the extension cast are Tim Hamner (see above), documentary filmmaker Harvey Randall, and United States senator Arthur Jellison. The book has a lot of soap opera moments that doesn't equate to much — Barry Price is sleeping with his secretary, Harvey Randall sleeps with the senator's daughter Maureen... etc.

These soap opera moments are similar to _Footfall_. They don't have much bearing on the overall story, as their purpose is to simply add a little spice to the long opening setup. Speaking of similarities to _Footfall_, Mark Czescu is very similar to _Footfall_'s Hairy Red. Both are bikers, not totally winning at life, who sing for their supper. It's a bit weird that two such similar characters would feature in two such similar books.

But then the comet strikes and the book kicks into high gear. The comet spares no one — and only those able to scramble to higher ground survive the torrents of water. From space, we witness China and Russia enter a game of "who can nuke who first". Things aren't looking too good.

The book is interspersed with poet snippets that describe the great destruction of The Hammer, but for the most part, the story is set in California. Nearly every character introduced early on has an important part to play in the latter stages of the book — unlike _Footfall_, which often introduced characters that faded out of the story by the third act.

The final third of the book focuses on a small township attempting to survive the aftermath. They face tough ethical choices — and eventually decide to set up barricades to keep desperate "refugees" out of their town. Food is scarce, as the characters eventually agree they can "only be as ethical as they can afford to be". This is a bit different from the more liberal Hollywood disaster stories, in which there is usually an impassioned speech declaring that we must help all people wherever possible, despite the dire situation at hand. Lucifer's Hammer takes a grimmer view of how humanity would act during the apocalypse. 

And so we get to the inevitable part where we discuss the dated aspects of the book. Yep, _Lucifer's Hammer_ was written in 1977, and its treatment of women, race and environmentalism is not in line with modern thinking.

There are quite a few female characters (which is an improvement over _The Mote In God's Eye_, at least), but they're nearly always defined in their relationship to a male character. Maureen is Senator Jellison's daughter. Dolores is Barry Price's love interest. Marie Vance is Harvey's neighbour. The only exception is the Russian doctor and _kosmonaut_ Leonilla Malik, but she is part of the supporting cast. The book often makes remarks about "women's liberation" — a rather dated phrase, which I suppose was a big deal back in the 70s. 

Although the book has a few black characters (Rick Delanty, Hook and Alim Nasoor), the authors chose to have a bunch of black people wind up as crazy cannibals by the third act. Okay, there are white cannibals too, but a lot of them are black. Alim Nasoor is also a murderer and a thief, which means the only non-white character who is also a decent bloke is astronaut Rick Delanty. There are no Asian characters, no Indians, no Australians... Although I wouldn't say the book is outright racist (and I certainly don't believe Niven and Pournelle harbour such attitudes, even in secret), by today's _woke_ standards the book could use a more balanced cast of characters.

Finally, the book has a rather dated view of environmentalism. Nuclear power is good, and those pesky environmentalists are always carrying on about CFCs in aerosol cans! Today, climate change is the single biggest threat to humanity — so to read a book that treats environmentalists as wackos is a bit worrying.

Whether the above prevents you from enjoying the story is really down to the individual. The book is 45 years old, and although I'm a pretty woke kind of person, I'm willing to forgive it for the most part. It's never outright racist, sexist or anti-environment. It just takes a more conservative view than the current mainstream point of view. Personally, I found it a bit annoying more than anything, as the dated aspects sometimes jerk me out of the exciting story world.

Otherwise, the book holds up remarkably well considering its age. Niven and Pournelle are just such a powerful writing team — the story is paced beautifully (despite being double the length of a typical novel) and the excitement builds and builds as the story progresses. Countless movies such as _2012_, _The Day After Tomorrow_ and _Deep Impact_ owe a great debt to _Lucifer's Hammer_. Without books like this, I doubt we'd have those movies.

 Overall, _Lucifer's Hammer_ was a gripping read by the best in the business. Yes, some aspects of it are frustratingly dated, but if you can look past those faults it's an absolute ripping yarn, and a worthy addition to anyone's sci-fi book collection.
