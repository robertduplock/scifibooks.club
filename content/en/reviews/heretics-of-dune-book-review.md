*Heretics of Dune* continues to long and bizarre Dune saga, which began with Frank Herbert's original Dune, written in 1966. After the lacklustre snoozefest that was God Emperor of Dune, I was hoping this book would lift the franchise back up to somewhere near its potential.

The book does indeed suffer from some of the foibles common amongst Dune sequels â€” it's overly long, and over-written; often reaching for a kind of literary mastery that belies a very talented writer who is stuck writing crummy sci-fi and space opera.
