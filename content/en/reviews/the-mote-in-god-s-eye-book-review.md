Published in 1974, _The Mote In God's Eye_ was a runaway success. It combined the space opera of Star Trek, the world building of Dune and the militaristic backbone of Starship Troopers. It's 537 pages of space faring goodness. And if you think Europe has a lot of museums, just wait until you get to Mote Prime.

Unlike Star Trek, Dune and Starship Troopers, _The Mote In God's Eye_ shows its age. Race still divides people. The Scottish accent has survived for 1000 years, even when humanity has colonised every rocky planet within spitting distance. Unlike Trek, which was woke 50 years before the term even existed, _The Mote In God's Eye_ feels rooted in the 70s. Themes of race, overpopulation, xenophobia and the militaryâ€“industrial complex weave their way into the story.

If you are going to read a book written five decades ago, of course you have to give a few things a pass. Mostly, the retro aspects didn't worry me too much.

_The Mote In God's Eye_ features a large cast of characters. The main character, Rod Blaine, is a vaguely Captain Kirk-ish figure, with a tendency to touch his nose when he's feeling insecure. His counterpart is the scary Russian stereotype Kutuzov, a man so dedicated to keeping humanity safe, he'd sleep just fine after an unprecedented act of genocide. And indeed, it nearly comes to that.

Fans of diversity will be thrilled to find there is but a single female character, Sally. Who is both there to be Rod's progressive conscience and his love interest. Ok, technically all the Motie except for a few are female. But they don't really count.

The world building is impressive in its scope and detail. Like Dune, _The Mote In God's Eye_ builds a complex world. Also like Dune, many of the details are simply their to build a highly believable setting, rather than playing an active role. Dune is set mainly on Arrakis, _The Mote In God's Eye_ is set mainly on the ship _MacArthur_ and the Motie's homeworld. The universe in which the book takes place is known as the _CoDominium_. Many of Pournelle's other works take place in this universe. This book remains independent, and does not need to be read as part of a larger story.

The aliens themselves are really the stars of the show. They are lopsided and grotesque, with permanent smile planted on their face, like a politician at a dinner party. Once the humans make contact, they get to visit Mote Prime and see the sights. First stop on the Motie's Hop-on Hope-off bus is one of many museums. It turns out the Moties breed like rabbits. Overpopulation, followed by cataclysmic wars, is simply par-for-the-course on their world. So the population keeps a few time capsules for next time their entire civilisation crumbles and the neo-caveman Moties need to start again.

My main gripe with the storyline is that I just never really saw the Moties as much of a threat. Everyone is so paranoid all the time, except for Sally and a few of the scientists. The basic premise is that, due to their crazy engineering skills and a breeding rate that'd put the typical rabbit to shame, they will expand into humanity's terroritory and start stirring up trouble. To think that would cause humanity so much distress that they would send a big old bomb with Die Motie's Die scrawled on the side just never quite rang true for me.

What the book does offer is a very fun, very readable space opera adventure. It's a first contact story. It's a mishmash of different tropes. As always, Niven and Pournelle write in a lean-and-clean style, which is easy to read and keeps the focus on the story and characters. It's the kind of writing that doesn't draw attention to itself. There are a lot of characters to keep track of. Like Niven and Pournelle's _Footfall_, certain characters don't really serve any obvious function. For example Nabil, Horace Bury's servant/assassin, is touted to be an underhanded, sneaky threat. And yet that particular Chekhov's gun never fires. Nabil does pretty much nothing.

Also similarly to Footfall, the aliens did come acrosss as quite samey. The idea of the _Fyunch(click)_ was cool, with every main character getting their own Motie _other_. But ultimately, they were something of a homogenous group, thinking and acting like one multi-bodied character. 

Niven and Pournelle have become of my favourite authors. Having now read two of their works, I am looking forward to reading _Lucifer's Hammer_ next_._ Each of their singular books is the size of a typical YA trilogy, so you get good value when you pick up on of their tomes. 

_The Mote In God's Eye_ is an epic adventure, full of original ideas and fun characters. Yes, in some ways it hasn't aged that well. And yes, it does get a big bogged down in the second act. Perhaps it could have been 50 pages shorter. But it's still a worthwhile read, even in 2021.
