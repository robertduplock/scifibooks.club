* Humanity is still divided by race
* Overpopulation is a theme
* Found it hard to see the Motie as such a big threat
* World building detailed yet in the background (like Dune)
* No female human characters other than Sally
* Hints of hard sci fi
* Museums
* Crazy Eddie
* Jump points

Published in 1974, _The Mote In God's Eye_ was a runaway success. It combined the space opera of Star Trek, the world building of Dune and the militaristic backbone of Starship Troopers. It's 537 pages of space faring goodness. And if you think Europe has a lot of museums, just wait until you get to Mote Prime.

Unlike Star Trek, Dune and Starship Troopers, _The Mote In God's Eye_ shows its age. Race still divides people. The Scottish accent has survived for 1000 years, even when humanity has colonised every rocky planet within spitting distance. Unlike Trek, which was woke 50 years before the term even existed, _The Mote In God's Eye_ feels rooted in the 70s. Themes of race, overpopulation, xenophobia and the militaryâ€“industrial complex weave their way into the story.

If you are going to read a book written five decades ago, of course you have to give a few things a pass. Mostly, the retro aspects didn't worry me too much.

_The Mote In God's Eye_ features a large cast of characters. The main character, Rod Blaine, is a vaguely Captain Kirk-ish figure, with a tendency to touch his nose when he's feeling insecure. His counterpart is the scary Russian stereotype Kutuzov, a man so dedicated to keeping humanity safe, he'd sleep just fine after an unprecedented act of genocide. And indeed, it nearly comes to that.

Fans of diversity will be thrilled to find there is but a single female character, Sally. Who is both there to be Rod's progressive conscience and his love interest. Ok, technically all the Motie except for a few are female. But they don't really count.

The world building is impressive in its scope and detail. Like Dune, _The Mote In God's Eye_ builds a complex world. Also like Dune, many of the details are simply their to build a highly believable setting, rather than playing an active role. Dune is set mainly on Arrakis, _The Mote In God's Eye_ is set mainly on the ship _MacArthur_ and the Motie's homeworld. The universe in which the book takes place is known as the _CoDominium_. Many of Pournelle's other works take place in this universe. This book remains independent, and does not need to be read as part of a larger story.

The aliens themselves are really the stars of the show. They are lopsided and grotesque, with permanent smile planted on their face, like a politician at a dinner party. Once the humans make contact, they get to visit Mote Prime and see the sights. First stop on the Motie's Hop-on Hope-off bus is one of many museums. It turns out the Moties breed like rabbits. Overpopulation, followed by cataclysmic wars, are simply par-for-the-course on their world. So the population keeps a few time capsules for next time their entire civilisation crumbles and the neo-caveman Moties need to start again.

My main gripe with the storyline is that I just never really saw the Moties as much of a threat. Everyone is so paranoid all the time, except for Sally and a few of the scientists.
