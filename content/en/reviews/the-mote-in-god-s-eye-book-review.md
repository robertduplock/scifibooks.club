* Humanity is still divided by race
* Overpopulation is a theme
* Found it hard to see the Motie as such a big threat
* World building detailed yet in the background (like Dune)
* No female human characters other than Sally
* Hints of hard sci fi
* Museums
* Crazy Eddie
* Jump points

Published in 1974, _The Mote In God's Eye_ was a runaway success. It combined the space opera of Star Trek, the world building of Dune and the militaristic backbone of Starship Troopers. It's 537 pages of space faring goodness. And if you think Europe has a lot of museum, just wait until you get to Mote Prime. 

Unlike Star Trek, Dune and Starship Troopers, _The Mote In God's Eye_ does show it's age. People are still divided by race. The Scottish accent has survived for 1000 years, even when humany has colonised every rocky planet within spitting distance. Unlike Trek, which was woke 50 years before the term even existed, _The Mote In God's Eye_ feels rooted in the 70s. Themes of race, overpopulation, xenophobia and the militaryâ€“industrial complex weave their way into the story.
