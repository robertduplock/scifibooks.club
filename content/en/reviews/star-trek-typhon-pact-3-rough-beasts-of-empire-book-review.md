The third book in the Typhon Pact series is here. Rough Beasts of Empire was written by David R. George III back in 2011. It's a book of two parts: the first focuses on Benjamin Sisko (from Deep Space Nine) in the post Destiny era, and the second focuses on Spock and his quest for the reunification of Vulcan and Romulus.

**Spoilers ahead.**

Before I get into the details of this review, I'm just going to get the obvious stuff out of the way. The Benjamin Sisko storyline sucks, while the Spock storyline is pretty good. However, if you've read the book or read other reviews, there seems to be an almost universal consensus that _Rough Beasts of Empire_ is 50% of a good book.

Okay, now that I've got that out of the way — I will also point out that, despite this book being #3 in the Typhon Pact series, it is chronologically the first. So now it makes a lot of sense why some people recommend reading this one before [_Typhon Pact #1 Zero Sum Game_](https://scifibooks.club/reviews/typhon-pact-1-zero-sum-game-book-review/) and [_Typhon Pact #2 Seize The Fire_](https://scifibooks.club/reviews/typhon-pact-2-seize-the-fire-book-review/)_._

I haven't read the other Deep Space Nine books set after the series finale, so coming into this novel, I wasn't sure what Benny Sisko had been up to since the show. Deep Space Nine ended with him becoming a pseudo-God, adopted by the Bajoran prophets. Now, he's back in corporeal form and helping with the whole Borg invasion thing (see [_Star Trek: Destiny_](https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-the-next-generation-destiny-trilogy-book-review-e/)).

But, as other reviews have pointed out, the Sisko we see in _Rough Beasts of Empire_ feels divorced from the character we came to know and love on the show. The Bajoran Prophets have stopped returning his texts and unfriended him on Facebook. And in the wake of the recent Borg destruction, he's convinced himself that if he stays with his Wife (Kassidy Yates) and daughter, he's doomed to a life of misery (because that's what the prophets said would happen in the show).

I have stated in earlier reviews that one of my three golden rules of tie-in novels is that no character should behave incongruently with their onscreen counterpart. Unfortunately, the Sisko storyline is an epic fail when held up against this rule. After watching him struggle for seven seasons as a single father, he then abandons his wife and child to the same fate. And I won't even get into the racial aspects of it either. Safe to say, I think Avery Brooks would never have dreamed Sisko could take such a huge step back.

However, it's not all bad. I found the Spock/Romulan storyline to be a pleasant surprise. Spock and his small group of comrades secretly run a movement to unify the Vulcan and Romulan people. For those who don't know, Romulans and Vulcans share a common heritage but developed vastly different cultures. I'm not typically an enthusiast of Romulan stories — and although it was a bit slow to start with, I found myself sucked drawn the Romulan plotting, backstabbing and intrigue. 

Essentially, Spock pitches the idea of decriminalising the reunification movement, suggesting that it would help encourage the unification of the fractured Romulan empire — Donatra controls one half while Tal'Aura controls the other. But ultimately, he is used by Tal'Aura, who ultimately takes control of the empire... only to find herself slumped over and drooling on the floor. Because lurking in the background is the Tzenkethi, secretly running the show.

Perhaps I would have preferred the ending because the Romulans remained in control rather than the Tzenkethi. However, because the Tzenkethi were so easily able to pull the strings, the Romulan's penchant for scheming, plots, and double-crosses aren't as formidable as we're led to believe. Nevertheless, it was nice to see the post-Nemesis/Romulan plot continue from earlier relaunch books such as [_Death In Winter_](https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-the-next-generation-death-in-winter-book-review/) and [_Taking Wing_](https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-titan-taking-wing-book-review-i/).
