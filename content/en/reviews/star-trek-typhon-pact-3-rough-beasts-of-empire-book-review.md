The third book in the Typhon Pact series is here. Rough Beasts of Empire was written by David R. George III back in 2011. It's a book of two parts: the first focuses on Benjamin Sisko (from Deep Space Nine) in the post Destiny era, and the second focuses on Spock and his quest for the reunification of Vulcan and Romulus. 

**Spoilers ahead.**

Before I get into the details of this review, I'm just going to get the obvious stuff out of the way. The Benjamin Sisko storyline sucks, while the Spock storyline is pretty good. However, if you've read the book or read other reviews, there seems to be an almost universal consensus that _Rough Beasts of Empire_ is 50% of a good book.

Okay, now that I've got that out of the way â€” I will also point out that, despite this book being #3 in the Typhon Pact series, it is chronologically the first. So now it makes a lot of sense why some people recommend reading this one before [_Typhon Pact #1 Zero Sum Game_](https://scifibooks.club/reviews/typhon-pact-1-zero-sum-game-book-review/) and [_Typhon Pact #2 Seize The Fire_](https://scifibooks.club/reviews/typhon-pact-2-seize-the-fire-book-review/)_._

I haven't read the other Deep Space Nine books set after the series finale, so coming into this novel, I wasn't sure what Benny Sisko had been up to since the show. Deep Space Nine ended with him becoming a pseudo-God, adopted by the Bajoran prophets. Now, he's back in corporeal form and helping with the whole Borg invasion thing (see [_Star Trek: Destiny_](https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-the-next-generation-destiny-trilogy-book-review-e/)).

But, as other reviews have pointed out, the Sisko we see in _Rough Beasts of Empire_ feels totally divorced from the character we came to know and love on the show. Apparently, the Bajoran Prophets have stopped returning his texts and they've unfriended him on Facebook. And in the wake of the recent Borg destruction, he's convinced himself that if he stays with his Wife (Kassidy Yates) and daughter, then he's doomed to a life of misery (because that's what the prophets said would happen in the show).
