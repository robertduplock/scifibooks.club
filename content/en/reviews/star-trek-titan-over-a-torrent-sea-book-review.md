Christopher L Bennet and I got beef. Of course, he wouldn't know me from a bar of soap. But reading through the post-Nemesis Star Trek litverse, I've now read 14 books in the series. And I hate to say it, but Bennet is my least favourite Trek writer. 

_Over A Torrent Sea_, published in 2009 and fifth Titan spinoff, is the perfect example of why Bennet and I don't gel. But firstly, let me list some of the things I _like_ about Bennet. He has an imagination bigger than a member of the Q continuum, a solid grasp of character, and he's dedicated to Trek lore -- often choosing to plug small gaps in Trek canon with well-considered Easter-eggy details. 

What's not to like then? You see, Bennet commits the cardinal sin of genre fiction. His books are boring. They're are books that sit on my nightstand, haunting me, the bookmark permanetly stuck halfway through. With the exception of his decent Trek novel _Greater Than The Sum_, I've found all of his Trek books so far to be boring. But _Over A Torrent Sea_ was the boringest of them all. It reads somewhere between a marine biology textbook and a fanfiction epic posted on Archive Of Our Own. 

Sigh. Look, it's not in my nature to criticise the author, even if I do criticise the work.
