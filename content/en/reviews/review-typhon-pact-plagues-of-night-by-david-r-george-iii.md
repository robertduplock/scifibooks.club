David R George III returned to treklit and the Typhon Pact crossover series with the first book in the the Khitomer Accords trilogy, which rounded out the entire Typhon Pact story. *Plagues of Night* focuses mainly on Ben Sisko's post-emissary life and the Romulans. 

**Spoilers ahead**

<!--more-->

I won't lie — the Typhon Pact has not been my favourite Treklit series. The books have been disjointed, and the overall arc rather vague. A couple of the early books were pretty awful, but I developed a soft spot for David R. George III's earlier Typhon Pact entry, *Rough Beasts Of Empire*.

The storyline is partially about Ben Sisko, and his struggles with his family. He's ditched his wife and daughter because the Bajoran prophets told him life would be miserable if he stayed with them. Secondly, the Romulans are trying to even up the technological score with the Federation and their dang slipstream drive. They manage to score some schematics, but they need some serious tech to bring it all together.

Firstly, David R. George III manages to do something few writers can boast — he manages to make the Romulans interesting. At least to me. I think his over-the-top (perhaps melodramatic) writing style suits the Romulan characters really well. I found the post-Nemesis world of Romulan politics a bit dull in earlier relaunch novels, but these latest twists and turns have been quite enjoyable.

In short, David R. George III has a unique style, which suits some aspects of Trek but not others. A lot of the quibbles I had with his previous novel (*Rough Beasts Of Empire*) are present here. So, at the risk of retreading old tyres, here goes:

Firstly, his style can be a little slow. I would at times find myself skimming over long paragraphs of description just to get to the next bit of dialogue. Secondly, the overall storyline to *Plagues of Night* didn't have a strong, throbbing pulse. In other words, I was never quite sure where it was going. Thirdly, David R. George III has a tendency to use too many big words. Here are a few of my favourites:

1 2 3

Honestly, how many people would know what these obscure words mean, without turning to a dictionary?

Also, the storyline regarding Ben S leaving his wife and kid sucks. Period. I know DRGIII probably had his reasons (maybe the story came from above) but it still sucks. 

But all that being said, I found myself really enjoying this book. In particular, the scenes involving the Enterprise and Captain Picard were very well done, and (unlike Sisko) I really enjoyed seeing the progress Picard has made as a character throughout the books. *Plagues of Night* actually had the courage to work Picard into some meaty scenes, and it really paid off.

Although it does seem like the Typhon Pact saga is limping to a bit of a lame conclusion, at least it's going out with a certain decree of charm and style. While I'll never truly love DRGIII's writing style, I've come to appreciate unique take on Trek, and I can see he's very well suited to DS9 and Romulan worlds.
