**Spoiler review: God Emperor of Dune** 

<!-- more -->

In an excellent review of _God Emperor of Dune_, found on [Tor.com](https://www.tor.com/2018/11/07/the-one-book-that-made-me-take-the-long-view-of-the-future-god-emperor-of-dune/), writer Jo Walton once said: "\[...\] each of Frank Herbertâ€™s Dune novels is about half as good as the one before it."

It's a reasonable position to take. Each book, at least thus far, has become increasingly challenging to read. Gone is the epic, Shakespearean adventure found in the original Dune. Love, lust, betrayal, murder, politics, backstabbing â€” and that spicy cinnamon-scented melange. Oh yes, the first book is layered and deep â€” and yet totally engrossing and virtually _unputdownable_. 

Evidence suggests that Frank Herbert was never really that interested in writing the Dune sequels. From the second book (_Dune Messiah_) onwards, the books take a pivotal turn. Gone is the heady sense of adventure. Instead, the books become something of a slow-burn â€” drawn out and philosophical. I can't help but feel his publishers pressured him into writing more Dune novels, and Herbert buried his sense of resentment between the lines of those books.

_God Emperor of Dune_ starts out with a beautifully crafted action scene, in which Siona and her rebellious friends are running away from Leto's Citadel, chased by a pack of bloodthirsty D-wolves. After _Children of Dune_, it had taken me a good while to work up the courage to crack of the covers of this one â€” but then the opening scene! I was cautiously optimistic the book might get less bogged down in pseudo-philosophical ramblings than it's predecessor.

Boy was I wrong.

The book promises a rebellion, lead by Siona, against the 3000 year despotic rule of Leto II. But we quickly leave her behind, and instead we're subjected to countless "room scenes" featuring the dull-as-dishwater character of Moneo. What are "room scenes" you ask? I think of them scenes not rooted in action. Typically they go like this: Moneo walks into a room. He has a somewhat confusing and long-winded conversation with Leto. Moneo leaves the room. Rinse and repeat. 

"Room scenes" are the scourge of dull sci-fi stories. The Star Wars prequels were criticised for too many "room scenes". The quote a joke from the [Honest Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nJS-LPcFfw) of   _Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones:_

> \[...\] Strap yourself in for \[...\] People sitting and talking... Standing and talking... Walking and talking... One person standing and talking while another is sitting and talking... People standing and talking then taking a seat for more talking...

The book is crammed with long, talky scenes filled with pseudo-philosophical dialogue that barely advances the plot. The introduction of Duncan ghola does introduce some tension, and he steadfastly refuses to bend the knee and acknowledge Leto and the god emperor. 

And yet somehow I found myself often having a fun time reading it. There are some positives. For starters, the story is a lot less confusing than _Children of Dune_. And when the story does pick up, such as the scene where Duncan climbs the great wall of
