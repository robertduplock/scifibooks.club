**Spoiler review: God Emperor of Dune** 

<!-- more -->

In an excellent review of _God Emperor of Dune_, found on Tor.com, writer Jo Walton once said: "\[...\] each of Frank Herbertâ€™s Dune novels is about half as good as the one before it."

It's a reasonable position to take. Each book, at least thus far, has become increasingly challenging to read. Gone is the epic, Shakespearean adventure found in the original Dune. Love, lust, betrayal, murder, politics, backstabbing â€” and that spicy cinnamon-scented melange. Oh yes, the first book is layered and deep â€” and yet totally engrossing and virtually _unputdownable_. 

Evidence suggests that Frank Herbert was never really that interested in writing the Dune sequels.
