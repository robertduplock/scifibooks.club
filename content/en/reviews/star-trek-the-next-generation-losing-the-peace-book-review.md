On _Star Trek: The Next Generation_, when Picard became Locutus and helped slay thousands at Wolf 359, that double episode was followed up with the episode _Family,_ in which he travels to France to spend some time with his brother, of whom he does not get along with_._ William Leisner's _Losing The Peace_ is that kind of follow up, giving the readers a moment to breathe after the huge events of Star Trek: Destiny.
