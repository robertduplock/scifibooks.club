On _Star Trek: The Next Generation_, when Picard became Locutus and helped slay thousands at Wolf 359, that double episode was followed up with the episode _Family,_ in which he travels to France to spend some time with his brother, of whom he does not get along with_._ William Leisner's _Losing The Peace_ is that kind of follow up, giving the readers a moment to breathe after the huge events of _Star Trek: Destiny_.

**Spoilers ahead**

If you were to stumble upon this book as a casual Star Trek fan, you'd be pretty confused. _What, we liberated the entire Borg collective throughout the galaxy? Really? No, really?_ Well yes, that really happened. And now we're all in on the litverse. It's obvious at this point that there will be no more self-contained Star Trek books.

_Losing The Peace_ offers some nuanced thoughts regarding what might happen in the aftermath of a huge war. We spend some time with a Risian whose planet was destroyed while she was handing out cocktails on a cruise ship. Picard is just happy to the Borg voices in his head gone, while Geordi reconnects with his sister. Original litverse characters get their time as well. Choudhury struggles to align her deep spiritual beliefs with all the death and destruction, while Chen finds out her mother has breathed her last breath _and_ her deadbeat Dad is now back on the scene.  

These scenes are nice and help lay the new foundations. The new normal. This is the new _Enterprise_ crew. 

But the main focus of the book is a refugee crisis on Crusher— a heavily pregnant Crusher— and the role she plays helping with the refugee crisis on the water planet Pacifica. Yes, that's right folks. Refugees are not treated as they should. Queue the complaints: It's preachy. It's too SJW. It's too woke. Better go make an hour-long video on YouTube ranting about it...

Hang on.
