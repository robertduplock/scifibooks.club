There is something to be said for getting back to the status quo. Namely, putting the Voyager crew back into their original seats... more or less. With _Full Circle_, author Kirsten Beyer sent the U.S.S. Starship _Voyager_ hurtling back to the Delta Quadrant, thanks to some mean and lean slipstream technology. But the crew were still fractured, physically and emotionally — what will it take to bring Starfleet's finest back to the adventure?

Kirsten Beyer won a lot of hearts and minds with her previous Voyager novel, _Full Circle_. It reigned in the chaos of the previous books and began putting the pieces of the playset back into their rightful configuration. But she didn't rush it. I honestly thought by the end of Full Circle, we'd have seen B'Elanna, Tom, Chakotay, Seven — and even Admiral Janeway — back manning the consoles of _Voyager_'s bridge.

It became apparent that Beyer isn't one to rush things. For the most part, this is probably a good thing. Rushing things would only feel predictable and unearned. Instead, _Unworthy_ marches to the beat of its own _Ressikan flute_, er, so to speak. B'Elanna finally manages to shake off her chasers and even catches up with our favourite Talaxian chef, Neelix. Tom is forgiven by Eden for his deception, and Chakotay sneaks his way on board to help out poor Seven — who forgot to write her name on her underwear, so the Caelian Gestalt implanted a voice in her head instead.

Let's talk about the new characters. Eden and Batiste strike me as being Janeway and Chakotay in reverse. Eden is dark-skinned, even-tempered and of a lower rank. Batiste is impulsive, adventurous and commands the fleet with zeal. Okay, it's not a perfect comparison, but I do wonder if this is how the characters formed in Beyer's imagination.

The new counsellor, Hugh Cambridge, is an interesting character — but I can never quite buy into his abrasive style. It feels a bit forced at times. The other newer characters include Nancy Conlon, who buddies up with B'Elanna in engineering, Aytar Gwyn, whose hair is blue and don't you forget it, Doctor Sharak, who is just kind of there, and Kenth Lasren who is also, well, there.
