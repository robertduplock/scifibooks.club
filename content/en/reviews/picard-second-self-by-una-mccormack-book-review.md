Following on from the success of her season 1 prequel novel, *The Last Best Hope*, author Una McCormack returns to the world of Picard with *Second Self* — a new novel set in between seasons 1 & 2 of the TV show. Originally set to be released months ago, the novel has finally seen the light of day. So, was it worth the wait?

**Spoilers ahead!**

With ten Trek books behind her (and numerous other words), Una McCormack knows her way around the Treklit space. Naturally, I was looking forward to reading reading this one, and I'm happy to say the book did not disappoint. 

*Second Self* starts with Raffi struggling to figure out her next step — her career and personal life are both at a cross roads. Picard suggests she might try teaching at Starfleet Academy, but she isn't sure. As an alternative, Starfleet Intelligence need an off-the-books agent to help find an old Cardassian war criminal and bring him to justice. With some reluctance, she agrees, and brings Elnor along for the ride.

So, Raffi and Elnor head off to Ordeve — a place Raffi has visited before. And she does not have fond memories of the place. Both now and in the past, the place was a quagmire of complex politics — the world is inhabited by Romulans, Cardassians and Bajorans. 

The big twist is that the war criminal Raff is hunting down is none other than Elim Garak, from Deep Space Nine. Garak is a classic example of the [shapeshifter character archetype](https://mythcreants.com/blog/the-eight-character-archetypes-of-the-heros-journey/#shapeshifter) — and no, I do not mean the people like Odo and the Changelings. Rather, Garak is a character who plays both sides, and the viewer is never sure if he is a good guy or a bad guy... or simply a bit of both.

I've not read any of the previous Deep Space Nine books, so I'm not sure if Garak's post-TV fate was ever explored in previous novels. But we are now in the Picard timeline, and in this book, Garak is really a big part of the story. So much so, that there is a single, long chapter totally focused on Garak. And what a brilliant chapter it is. Beautiful written, and it provides an amazing backstory into Garak's early involvement with the dreaded Obsidian Order.
