Following on from the success of her season 1 prequel novel, *The Last Best Hope*, author Una McCormack returns to the world of Picard with *Second Self* — a new novel set in between seasons 1 & 2 of the TV show. Originally set to be released months ago, the novel has finally seen the light of day. So, was it worth the wait?

**Spoilers ahead!**

With ten Trek books behind her (and numerous other words), Una McCormack knows her way around the Treklit space. Naturally, I was looking forward to reading reading this one, and I'm happy to say the book did not disappoint. 

*Second Self* starts with Raffi struggling to figure out her next step — her career and personal life are both at a cross roads. Picard suggests she might try teaching at Starfleet Academy, but she isn't sure. As an alternative, Starfleet Intelligence need an off-the-books agent to help find an old Cardassian war criminal and bring him to justice. With some reluctance, she agrees, and brings Elnor along for the ride.

So, Raffi and Elnor head off to Ordeve — a place Raffi has visited before. And she does not have fond memories of the place. Both now and in the past, the place was a quagmire of complex politics — the world is inhabited by Romulans, Cardassians and Bajorans. 

The big twist is that the war criminal Raff is hunting down is none other than Elim Garak, from Deep Space Nine. Garak is a classic example of the [shapeshifter character archetype](https://mythcreants.com/blog/the-eight-character-archetypes-of-the-heros-journey/#shapeshifter) — and no, I do not mean the people like Odo and the Changelings. Rather, Garak is a character who plays both sides, and the viewer is never sure if he is a good guy or a bad guy... or simply a bit of both.

I've not read any of the previous Deep Space Nine books, so I'm not sure if Garak's post-TV fate was ever explored in previous novels. But we are now in the Picard timeline, and in this book, Garak is really a big part of the story. So much so, that there is a single, long chapter totally focused on Garak. And what a brilliant chapter it is. Beautiful written, and it provides an amazing backstory into Garak's early involvement with the dreaded Obsidian Order.

Which brings me to my next point: is this a Picard novel, or a Deep Space Nine novel? Jean-Luc himself is barely in it, and Rios only appears in a few scenes. And even though the Elnor and Raffi scenes are a hoot, once we delve into Raffi's past, it very much feels like she has been injected into the DS9 oeuvre.

It will really depend on your perspective, but I reckon the book does an amazing job of sewing the Picard timeline in with DS9 and, in particular, the aftermath of the Dominion War. I didn't mind that, at times, it felt a bit more like a DS9 book than a Picard story. Because Una McCormack did a great job of letting the book exist in both worlds. After all, it's all Trek... right?

Speaking of the author: Una McCormack obviously has a real affinity with the character of Raffi Musiker. And just as I said in my review of The Last Best Hope, McCormack does a wonderful job in fleshing out Raffi's character. I never felt much of a connection with her on-screen character, but in book form, I really enjoy spending time with her. 

I have a couple of small nitpicks with the book. Firstly, it's a bit vague as to why Elnor should come along for the mission. Picard just sort of says, "I think it'd be good for him," even though it's a delicate and probably dangerous mission. Sure, Elnor can obviously take care of himself, but he's not even in Starfleet!

Secondly, some may feel like the book is too deeply rooted in Deep Space Nine lore. Perhaps it could have been good to see Picard or another character such as Agnes take part in the story. It was very Raffi heavy, and she was really the only character full repping the Picard cast. 

Okay, let's talk about the ending. In particular, fate of Garak. Firstly, I should mention that I am not a huge DS9 fan, and I find some of the stuff to do with the Orbs and the Prophets a bit silly. In that sense, I'm pretty easy going about where Garak ends up. Interested, yes — but it's not like I have an extensive head-canon in which Garak gets his comeuppance. But, overall, I liked the idea that Garak would travel back in time to atone for his terrible sins, with a little help from the Orb of Restitution.

I wondered if this book would tie up some of the loose ends between season 1 and 2. In a sense, it did. It explains how Raffi and Elnor both end up at the academy, and why the pair had grown so close by the time season 2 starts.

Overall, I really enjoyed Second Self. It's a character driven story, with Raffi and Garak providing the heard and soul of the story. This is one not to be missed.
