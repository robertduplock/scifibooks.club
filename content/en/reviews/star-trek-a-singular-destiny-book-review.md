The Federation must deal with the fallout from the explosive events of _Star Trek: Destiny_.  Poor President Bacco has developed a 24 hour migraine, as she tries to patch the Federation back together. Who does she call? Why, none other than Earth's resident problem solver and people persuader, Sonek Pran. The only battles in this book will be diplomatic ones. _Star Trek: A Singular Destiny_ by Keith R.A. DeCandido offers a thoughtful epilogue to _Destiny_ and also sets up some future storylines.

It was a rather dreadful week for the Federation, with more than sixty billion of it's citizens turned to dust. The war with the Borg made Wolf 359 look like a game of cops and robbers. _A Singular Destiny_ includes a number of stories that intertwine but appear to be separate at first. There is an explosion at an important mining site. The Klingon's lose a planet of seemingly little strategic value. And the Romulan's will no longer accept the Federation's leftovers.
