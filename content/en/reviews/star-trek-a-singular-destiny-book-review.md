The Federation must deal with the fallout from the explosive events of _Star Trek: Destiny_.  Poor President Bacco has developed a 24 hour migraine, as she tries to patch the Federation back together. Who does she call? Why, none other than Earth's resident problem solver and people persuader, Sonek Pran. The only battles in this book will be diplomatic ones. _Star Trek: A Singular Destiny_ by Keith R.A. DeCandido offers a thoughtful epilogue to _Destiny_ and also sets up some future storylines.

It was a rather dreadful week for the Federation, with more than sixty billion of it's citizens turned to dust. The war with the Borg made Wolf 359 look like a game of cops and robbers. _A Singular Destiny_ includes a number of stories that intertwine but appear to be separate at first. There is an explosion at an important mining site. The Klingon's lose a planet of seemingly little strategic value. And the Romulan's will no longer accept the Federation's leftovers.

Mr DeCandido excels at a certain kind of storytelling that I think of as _A simple story, well executed._ This book however I felt tried to weave a more complex story. It worked for the most part, but at times it felt a bit bogged down. Nearly all the characters are original, so there is no giddy thrill of seeing Picard or Janeway on the page. 

The little excerpts and comminiques throughout the book showing different people struggling with the aftermath of the ware are interesting, even if they do feel a bit like filler at times. Like his previous Trek book, _Q&A_, DeCandido likes to use different, one-shot characters to offer different viewpoints on a single thing. In _Q&A_, it was the cosmic tear in spacetime. In this book, it is the aftermath of the war.

Somehow, the prose of A Singular Destiny didn't feel as tight as his other works. It would often tell the reader what had happened, and explain things, rather than showing the reader using real-time, concrete scenes. Take this excerpt for example:

> “Altoss was waiting only semi-patiently. Sonek didn’t need any particular skills in reading body language to see that the Efrosian ensign was ready to jump out of her skin”

This passage _tells_ us how Altoss is acting. It doesn't show us. It could be rewritten someting

> Altoss shifted her body weight, her eyes darting around the room. The Efrosian ensign glanced down at her phaser, then back at the room.

In my opinion, this kind of immediate, action-based writing is a lot more dynamic and engaging. 

That said, DeCandido is still an excellent writer. He brings his trademark relaxed, fun style to the story, even when it deals with heavy themes. It explores the tragic side of life without feeling overly sentimental or saccharine. My one gripe was Pran's reaction to the death of his wife. It was a story element that felt shoehorned in, and I didn't really buy his grief. I might have made it so she had already died at the beginning of the book, and he was still struggling with the pain of it.  

I can't say I've ever felt much love for exploring the intracacies of Romulan politics -- a subject that bogged down some of the early relaunch titles. In _A Singular Destiny_ however, I found Sonek's meeting with Donatra to be one of the most enjoyable aspects. Sonek, as Federation diplomat, tries to broker a piece between Donatra and her Romulan counterpart Tal'Aura. He tries and fails. But it's interesting to see how it all plays out.

The book of course offers a direct lead-in to the upcoming _Typhon Pact_ series. It does an excellent job of naturally building a prelude event without telegraphing it, or tacking it on because the editor said so. That being said, it's super weird that DeCandido himself did not go on to write any of the _Typhon Pact_ novels.

It was also a lot of fun to catch up with Ezri Dax and her crew aboard the _U.S.S. Aventine_. Although I didn't totally buy the whole _Bowers v Pran_ thing, I did enjoy the scenes where he was onboard, joining in on the jam sessions and generally stirring up trouble. I think it would have been great for the _U.S.S. Aventine_ to get it's own book series. I know they will show up here and there in future books, but I don't think we will get to see them in much detail.

My impression of Keith R.A. DeCandido is that he is an outgoing guy who loves to talk. He stated in an interview that he wanted to give Sonek Pran the "superpower" of being able to speak to people. He certainly does, er, speak to a lot of people. 

Apart from being a prelude to _Typhon Pact,_ the book also acts as a pseudo-sequel to _Articles Of The Federation_ (aslo by DeCandido). It's very much in the same vein, exploring the inner-workings of Federation politics. I think I probably liked this one more than _Articles Of The Federation,_ but less so than his excellent _Q&A._

Overall, _A Singular Destiny_ is another solid read from DeCandido, and it has made me excited to get to the Typhon Pact series. Good on ya' KRAD, keep up the good work.
