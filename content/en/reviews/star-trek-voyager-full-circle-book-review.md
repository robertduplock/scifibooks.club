When Kirsten Beyer picked up the heavy gauntlet of the Voyager relaunch titles, she sure faced a challenge. Not only were their loose ends to tie up from the preceding novels — but she also had to a) Deal with "the Janeway thing" from _Before Dishonor_ b) Launch the Full Circle Fleet storyline and c) Work it all in with the aftermath of _Star Trek: Destiny_. 

Once more unto the Delta Quadrant, dear friends...

_Spoilers ahead_

Voyager (the show) remains a sentimental favourite for me. But it seems the relaunch novels didn't quite know what to do with the intrepid crew now they were back on terra firma. So when I read that Beyer's books would send them back to the Delta Quadrant, I thought it was a clever idea, bordering on genius. It was the thing that defined Voyager from other Trek iterations, and it just made sense to re-explore the region. It was a clever twist. 

The first half of the book is mainly spent tying up the Miral/_Kuvah'magh_ story, which I always found a bit blah. The second half is where the story really gets going. Admiral Batiste is cooking up a mischievous plan to send the naughty Voyager kids back to their bedrooms, except of course Admiral Janeway clearly states she thinks the plan is nuts. Beyer cleverly ties the Miral/_Kuvah'magh_ story in with the Full Circle Fleet, as B'Elanna plans to end the game of hide-and-seek she's playing with warriors of Gre'thor's by finding the best hidey-hole in the galaxy — which happens to cross paths with Voyager's new course.
