When Kirsten Beyer picked up the heavy gauntlet of the Voyager relaunch titles, she sure faced a challenge. Not only were their loose ends to tie up from the preceding novels â€” but she also had to a) Deal with "the Janeway thing" from _Before Dishonor_ b) Launch the Full Circle Fleet storyline and c) Work it all in with the aftermath of _Star Trek: Destiny_. 

Once more unto the Delta Quadrant, dear friends...
