When Kirsten Beyer picked up the heavy gauntlet of the Voyager relaunch titles, she sure faced a challenge. Not only were their loose ends to tie up from the preceding novels — but she also had to a) Deal with "the Janeway thing" from _Before Dishonor_ b) Launch the Full Circle Fleet storyline and c) Work it all in with the aftermath of _Star Trek: Destiny_. 

Once more unto the Delta Quadrant, dear friends...

_Spoilers ahead_

Voyager (the show) remains a sentimental favourite for me. But it seems the relaunch novels didn't quite know what to do with the intrepid crew now they were back on terra firma. So when I read that Beyer's books would send them back to the Delta Quadrant, I thought it was a clever idea, bordering on genius. It was the thing that defined Voyager from other Trek iterations, and it just made sense to re-explore the region. It was a clever twist. 

The first half of the book is mainly spent tying up the Miral/_Kuvah'magh_ story, which I always found a bit blah. The second half is where the story really gets going. Admiral Batiste is cooking up a mischievous plan to send the naughty Voyager kids back to their bedrooms, except of course Admiral Janeway clearly states she thinks the plan is nuts. Beyer cleverly ties the Miral/_Kuvah'magh_ story in with the Full Circle Fleet, as B'Elanna plans to end the game of hide-and-seek she's playing with warriors of Gre'thor's by finding the best hidey-hole in the galaxy — which happens to cross paths with Voyager's new course. 

But it's in the second half that the book really gets its warp engines revving. Admiral Batiste cooks up a crazy plan to send Voyager back to the very place they found themselves oh so lost in, but Janeway says something ain't to: _Over my dead body_. Well... since this is now post-_Destiny_, poor old Janeway has danced off into the darkness with Lady Q.

As the story progressed, I thought we would see Janeway beamed down in a ray of Q-infused light — she'd scoop of Seven and Chakotay and bam — Admiral Janeway commands the fleet while Captain Chakotay sits in _Voyager_'s big chair. By the time the last few chapters came about, the state of play became obvious, with O.G. characters Batiste in command of the fleet and Eden as the captain of _Voyager_. Personally, I would have ended the novel with Chakotay and Janeway in those spots. Still, since I haven't read any of the preceding novels since _A Farther Shore_, in the context of the other books it might have been too rushed to bring them back so soon.

Then there is the quality of Beyer's prose. At first, I struggled with it. I've criticised seasoned Trek writer Christopher L Bennet for telling/explaining too much to the reader. Well, Beyer is just about the telliest, explainiest writer I've come across. The number of times she literally tells the reader how a character feels is amazing. She breaks the most basic rules of "good writing" again and again.

However, her writing does carry a certain weight and punch. Once I forced myself to turn off my analytical brain and just _read_ the book, I found myself reading chapter after chapter until well past my bedtime. Not since the _Destiny_ trilogy did I find myself so compelled to keep flipping the pages.
