When Kirsten Beyer took the reigns of the Voyager relaunch books, she really had her work cut out for her. I can imagine her novel to-do list: a) Tie off the loose ends from Golden's preceding novels. b) Deal with the _Janeway thing_ from Peter David's disastrous _Before Dishonor_ c) Launch the new Full Circle fleet into the delta quadrant and d) Tie all this in with the aftermath of the _Destiny_ trilogy!

**Major spoilers ahead!**

Although "Project Full Circle" was mentioned back in the first Voyager relaunch novel, _Homecoming_, it wasn't until _this_ novel that it meant Voyager would return to the Delta Quadrant. 

The book, as many others have noted, is divided into two parts. The first focuses on B'Elanna, Tom and their baby Miral. As you may recall from the TV show, a travelling circus of Klingon's declared Miral the _Kuvah'magh_, a kind of religious saviour. And we all know how well things tend to end for religious saviours. 

Although the Miral storyline has a precedent in the show, it was never a plot thread I enjoyed. In fact, although I like B'Elanna as a character, her entire story arc so far in the relaunch has been rather blah. The Miral story, in which she is hunted down and kidnapped, etc, felt a lot like some editor desperately trying to inject some high-stakes drama into the relaunch. Except, like many good ideas, they don't survive the translation to the page. And so, by the end of the first part, I was glad to sense that storyline winding up. And indeed, Beyer found a clever way to merge that into the main story.

Let's talk about Janeway. _She dead_. I avoided saying that in the opening paragraph due to spoilers, but since it's in the first chapter of the book, I guess it's not really a spoiler as such. Janeway was given her angel's wings in an earlier TNG novel, although it had an obvious open-ended she-will-return vibe. I expected Beyer to bring Janeway back to life in this book. I kept waiting for it and waiting for it...

I don't know how I feel about Captain Eden & Admiral Batiste commanding Voyager and the Full Circle fleet. Personally, I would have ended the novel with Chakotay and Janeway in those spots. Still, since I haven't read any of the preceding novels since _A Farther Shore_, in the context of the other books it might have been too rushed to bring them back so soon.

Within a book or two, I predict Janeway will be ushered back to the land of the living, with Chakotay and Seven grabbing hold of the nearest slipstream drive and getting themselves alongside the Full Circle fleet.
