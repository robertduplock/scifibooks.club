After seven long years in stranded in the Delta Quadrant, Janeway finally managed to bring her crew back to the little blue planet she, and so many of her crew, call home. And cut. Draw the curtains and clean the stage. _Voyager_ is done. Of course, all good Trek geeks turn to the books to continue to events once she show ends. Thus, Voyager's relaunch is here, and veteran author Christie Golden is in charge.

<!--more-->

Star Trek: The Next Generation's first relaunch title, _Death In Winter_, got the post-TV/movie era off to a shaky start for Picard and his crew. I was hoping that the two-parter _Homecoming_ and _The Farther Shore_ would see Voyager's relaunch land on steadier ground.

After all, the series left a showbag jam-packed with loose ends that the books could build on. For example, after four seasons with nary a sultry look in Chakotay's direction, Seven finds herself suddenly in love with Chakotay in the season finale. _Homecoming_ had an obvious manifesto to quickly reverse that decision. There were plenty more loose ends too: How will the Doctor be treated? Will Tom Paris find peace with his father? Will the Marquee crew members face trial? I could go on...

The most common criticism of _Homecoming_ is that it views these loose ends as a bothersome obstacle, rather than an opportunity to organically grow some compelling storylines. And so Golden gets out her dustpan and brush, and quickly sweeps them up. No muss, no fuss.

In a way, I really feel for Golden. The problem with Star Trek books is that something needs to happen other than a bunch of the crew having lunch dates with their long-lost loved ones. And her story of a Borg virus was actually pretty clever. Infect, rather than assimilate. How do you explore the loose ends in a way that is dramatically satisfying to a space opera audience?

Reading the first half of Homecoming, I found that I quite enjoyed seeing each character get their brief moment in the sun. Harry reuniting with his parents (and Libby), for example, was a nice moment. But then, two-thirds in, the book is wrapped all that up, and suddenly the Borg virus is everywhere. Even that I didn't mind so much...

Of the three parts of the story that continue through to _The Farther Shore_, the story I particularly disliked was the holostrike. I can see how it could have sounded cool in theory. But in practice? If all "sentient holograms" go on strike, that essentially means The Federation have enslaved millions, perhaps billions, of sentient being. And if they aren't sentient, then it's impossible to have any sympathy for them. And holographich restaurant furniture? Does that mean the holographic seat that cushioned Janeway's butt in the resturant scene was secretly dreaming of another life as a kitchen countertop?

The other-other plot, involving B'Elanna, was reaonably well written but ultimately felt like a pointless diversion. It had no impact on the main story and obviously existed purely to set up future storylines. 

Golden has an interesting writing style that, for lack of a better word, one might described as old-fashioned. It's a pleasant writing style. It is neither verbose nor brief, neither lyrical nor lean-and-clean. However, by the second book, there was a lot of telling/explaining. Each chapter was like; _Here's Libby. Libby is thinking about a bunch of stuff. Libby calls someone. Oh no, Libby feels worried._ 

Something that annoys me as a reader is when an author keeps a piece of information away from me, in a lame attempt to build suspense. Golden does this when B'Elanna reads the letter from her mother, but the reader does not get the see the contents of that letter. Instead, B'Elanna folds it up, puts it in her pocket, and is like: "_See ya Tom and my newborn child, I'm off to probably die in some Klingon ritual even though I totally eschew Klingon culture. Bye._" As a reader, I am suppose to gasp and feverishly turn the pages until I discover the contents of the letter. In reality, I roll my eyes and put the book back on the nightstand.
