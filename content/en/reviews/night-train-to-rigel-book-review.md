Space trains. 

Those two words compelled me to pick up a secondhand copy of _Night Train to Rigel_ by Timothy Zahn. At the time I'd just moved to Sydney with my wife — we were house hunting, I was searching for a co-working space and adjusting to a new life in a new city. I suppose, to help me deal with all the stress, I was looking for a fun read. Entertaining escapism.

Enter the first entry in Mr Zahn's _Quadrail_ series.

<!-- more -->

The book starts with a classic Timothy Zahn hook. Frank Compton is a down-on-his-luck former Western Alliance Intelligence Agent, is visited by a mysterious stranger — who, of course, winds up dead by chapter 2. It turns out the Spiders, who run the Quadrail (an interstellar train system) need some help. Their trains are super safe, except someone has found out how to smuggle weapons on board, and that is most definitely not allowed if you read their Ts&Cs carefully. The Spiders run the trains, but no one really knows who or what they are.

One could say _Night Train to Rigel_ is a fast-paced action-adventure. Except when I say it's fast-paced, I mean it's _really_ fast-paced. Author Timothy Zahn wastes no time in getting to the meat of the story. Don't expect any lengthy scenes, filled with pathos and long goodbyes. Nope. Frank Compton is out there playing space cop by the time you can say "tickets please!"

Frank Compton is teamed up with Bayta, a blank-faced and emotionally distant woman who can communicate with the otherwise mute Spiders. Where Compton is brazen, brash and bold — Bayta is quiet, thoughtful and impassive. She's human, but you get the idea pretty early on that she's not quite _fully_ human if you catch my drift.

The book draws obvious inspiration from classic spy-thriller movies such as Hitchcock's North by Northwest and Strangers on a Train. In fact, in my head, I even imagined Carey Grant and Eva Marie Saint as the Quadrail riding characters Compton and Bayta.

The story has plenty of twists and turns. Perhaps a few too many twists and turns, actually, as at times the story can get muddled and confusing. And the whole thing is a little bit silly. But then, it's not a book you are supposed to take seriously. Rather, it's a whole lot of schlocky, pulpy fun.

Probably the best part of Night Train to Rigel is Mr Zahn's wonderful world-building, which includes an incredible cast of kooky and peculiar aliens. I really enjoyed the imagery of a train carriage filled with a bunch of Star Wars-esque aliens, chattering away in exotic languages and eating strange foods. Add to that the number of little details; self-wheeling luggage, ditrecs (what they call movies in the future), and shady secret agents.  

Mr Zahn is most famous for his Star Wars novels — in particular the _Heir to the Empire_ series featuring his original bad-guy creation Grand Admiral Thrawn. Personally, I've never read a Star Wars tie-in novel, but if I intended to I would definitely start with his post Return of the Jedi trilogy.
