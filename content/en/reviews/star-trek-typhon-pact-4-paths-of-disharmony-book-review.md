Intro

**Spoilers ahead**

<!--more-->

Review:

* Focuses on Picard
* Dayton Ward writes a bit verbosely
* Slow burn
* Character progression more like what I expected in book series
* Chen romance surprisingly effective
* Asked question: Will Picard become an admiral for the sake of his child?
* Ending with La Forge â€” Deus ex machina
