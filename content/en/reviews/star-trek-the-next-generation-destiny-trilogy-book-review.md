### History

David Mack was approached by Pocket Book editors Margaret Clarke and Marco Palmieri with a very specific request. Write a truly epic crossover trilogy. It had to be huge. It had to be an event. It had to be a statement piece.

After pitching a few ideas, Mack was told "sorry, not epic enough." Finally he asked them what sort of books they had in the pipeline. At the time, since books a written a year or two in advance, they had a lot of Borg stories on the agenda. "_Aha_!" said David Mack, who then pitched, sold, and wrote the _Destiny_ trilogy. 

It is interesting to note that the previous books were not specifically leading up to _Destiny_. It was more that _Destiny_ fit around them! It goes to show there wasn't exactly a clear vision on where the post-Nemesis timeline would go. It was still, somewhat, in flux.

Mack was told to keep _Voyager_ and _Deep Space 9_'s role in the books limited. This was because they had their independent post-TV stories going, and they wanted to ensure the _Destiny_ books wouldn't conflict.  

Since I read these books a little while ago, I've decided to review all three at the same time, as my memories of the specific parts is a little hazy.
