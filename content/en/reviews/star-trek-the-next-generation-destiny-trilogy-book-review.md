### History

David Mack was approached by Pocket Book editors Margaret Clarke and Marco Palmieri with a very specific request. Write a truly epic crossover trilogy. It had to be huge. It had to be an event. It had to be a statement piece.

After pitching a few ideas, Mack was told "sorry, not epic enough." Finally he asked them what sort of books they had in the pipeline. At the time, since books a written a year or two in advance, they had a lot of Borg stories on the agenda. "_Aha_!" said David Mack, who then pitched, sold, and wrote the _Destiny_ trilogy. 

It is interesting to note that the previous books were not specifically leading up to _Destiny_. It was more that _Destiny_ fit around them! It goes to show there wasn't exactly a clear vision on where the post-Nemesis timeline would go. It was still, somewhat, in flux.

Mack was told to keep _Voyager_ and _Deep Space 9_'s role in the books limited. This was because they had their independent post-TV stories going, and they wanted to ensure the _Destiny_ books wouldn't conflict.  

Since I read these books a little while ago, I've decided to review all three at the same time, as my memories of the specific parts is a little hazy.

### Story

A mysterious wreck is found by some of the _Deep Space 9_ crew, which turns out to be a long lost Federation ship. Fast forward 8 years and the Borg have launched their devastating attack in the Alpha quadrant. Captain Dax eventually figures out the wrecked ship is linked to the Borg incursion.

Rewind a century or two, and the early Starfleet vessel _Columbia_ is going about its merry way, until some Romulans show up and, long story short, they kept captured by the Caeliar. These guys love their privacy, so leaving is a no go.

Eventually _Titan_ find the Caeliar too, and they're also captured. Except a long time as passed and now former _Columbia_ captain Erika Hernandez is now in possession of some seriously Jedi like powers. She helps the Titan crew escape. Meanwhile, Federation President Nan Bacco gets an intergalactic Borg fighting band together, and they march off to fight the Borg.

Finally, the power Erika Hernandez poses as the Borg queen, in an attempt to liberate, rather than destroy the drones. We also find out, far into the past, the very first Borg is born... a bitter, angry, sick and confused Caeliar assimilates it's first victim.
