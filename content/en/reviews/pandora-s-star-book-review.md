_Pandora's Star_ is a beloved epic space-opera novel by British author Peter F Hamilton and the first in his Commonwealth series of books. Coming in at a whopping 768 pages, it's about 3x the length of a typical novel. Can this novel live up to the hype?

**Spoiler review**

<!--more-->

If you google something like "good space opera books", you will find people all over the internet recommending _Pandora's Star._ It's a huge book with a large cast of characters, but it basically boils down to three main story threads.

First and foremost, astronomer Dudley Bose discovers two star systems simultaneously enclosed by some kind of barrier — known as the Dyson Sphere. Thus, humans let their dang curiosity get their best, so they send a starship out to investigate. 

Meanwhile, these wacko folks who call themselves the Guardians believe a malevolent alien called the Starflyer secretly manipulates humanity into investigating the Dyson Sphere for its own nefarious purposes.

Thirdly, eccentric bazillionaire Ozzie Isaacs decides he needs to find the Silfen — a mysterious, childlike alien race — and ask them what's up with the Dyson Sphere. However, he gets trapped in a strange, icy world and has to eventually escape.
