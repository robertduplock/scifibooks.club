They don’t get much bigger than Asimov’s _Foundation_. Awarded “Best All-Time Series” in 1966, _Foundation_ was a trailblazer — some say it even invented the genre space opera. Needless to say, it’s difficult not to have high expectations.

**Spoilers ahead.**

<!--more-->

_Foundation_, written in the 1940s but collected and published in 1951_,_ has aged pretty well. It has that big, retro sci-fi feel, where anything is possible. Set it 50 000 years in the future? Sure. 25 million planets contained within a single empire? Hell yeah. 

Some parts of the book have aged like wine, others like milk. Let’s get the negatives out of the way. Firstly, I don’t think I counted a single female character. Not even _one_. Nada. Secondly, nuclear power is all the rage. In the future, the split atom is powering electric razors and clock radios. If my shaver came with the unfortunate side effect of bathing me with nuclear radiation, I might just grow myself a tidy beard. Thirdly, there are minor things like people chuffing on a cigar, or reading the newspaper. Most of this is pretty forgivable, assuming the no-girls-allowed doesn’t bother you too much. The book is 70 years old, after all.

_Foundation_’s story itself is a set of loosely connected novellas set within the same fictional universe. Each one leaps ahead in time, casting a new set of characters.

The most unexpected part of the story, for me, was the focus on religion. The Foundation keeps the pesky outer planets in check by turning their science into a spiritual belief system. Acolytes to the faith rote learn how to control their mighty machines, without understanding the mechanics behind them. As time progresses, religion loses its effectiveness. From there, trade becomes the emerging force by which The Foundation keeps itself in relative safety.

It seems that Hari Seldon can predict the future pretty well, and most of the time the characters keep out of history’s way until the next “Second Crisis” presents itself. On the face of it, a set of characters championing the idea of doing nothing — unless a hologram of the big man himself, Hari Seldon, rises from the metaphorical grave and gives direction to the nearest, man, woman or child what to do and where to go — could be a rather boring story. It’s often the tension between when to act and when to kick back that drives the narrative.

Asimov’s prose is lean and clean in the extreme. Terse, even. His descriptions of the wondrous future are bare and often rely on the reader's imagination to fill in the gaps. Although the book, particularly at first, can feel a bit rushed — I believe it’s Asimov’s succinct prose that helps the book to be so readable today. The arcana of futuristic technology or science never threatens to bog down the story.

Dialogue rules _Foundation_. A good portion of the book is spying on conversations. Backroom deals, political machinations and social manoeuvring. There are no space battles, no military institutions, and no alien bad guys to blow up.

Could we eventually learn to predict the future scientifically? Analyse the data, run the numbers, and predict the likely outcomes? Hari Seldon believes that _pschohistory_ — which is, I suppose, a pastiche of psychology and mathematics — can do just that. Believers in free will need not apply for a position in Hari Seldon’s team.

Given the book spans a couple of hundred years and lacks anything in the way of action or romance, I’d imagine anyone wanting to adapt it into a TV series would soon grow a lot of grey hairs and possibly take up day drinking. Not surprisingly, Apple TV’s “adaption” of the show is only loosely connected to the book’s plot. I don’t have a problem with gender flipping the main characters, or whatever other casting choices were made. But the story itself barely resembles what’s between the covers. For example, Salvor Hardin is now a trigger-happy town sheriff — whereas in the book he/she often quotes the phrase: _violence is the last refuge of the incompetent._ Okay, I realise some big character arc is probably being set up, in which Hardin learns that bigger guns don’t equal better results, but it’s difficult to watch the show and wonder why it had to stray so far from the source material.

For some reason, I often find myself comparing _Foundation_ to Frank Herbert’s _Dune_. I don’t know why, other than they’re both old-timey sci-fi books that I’ve read in recent years. For me, _Dune_ has aged better, although it was written many years later.

There is a lot to like about _Foundation_. It weaves together themes of free will, scientific persecution, religious institutional power and trade-vs-colonisation. If you can forgive the dated aspects — particularly the all-male cast — it holds up today as a genuinely clever study of how, in the face of crumbling civilisation, we might spend our lives in the pursuit of something truly bigger.
