Author Michael A. Martin returns to _Star Trek: Titan_ with _Seize The Fire_. The Gorn have joined the Typhon Pact, but they have a bit of a problem. Their warrior caste hatchery world has gone kablooey, and it's nigh-impossible to find another suitable location. Lucky for them, they have a big ol' terraforming device lying about. But Riker isn't so keen on the idea of them using it...

**Spoilers ahead!**

<!--more-->

The Gorn have gotten their dirty ~~hands~~ ~~claws~~ manus on a terraforming device they call an 'ecosculpture', but the rest of us call 'the genesis device from the third Star Trek movie'. They need it to create a suitable home for their younglings, but the only planet they've found suitable for, er, ecosculpting is already populated by a pre-warp race. Terraforming a planet has the unfortunate side-effect of wiping out the planet's indigenous life form — be they planet, mineral, vegetable or animal. 

Meanwhile, a group of has-been Gorn warriors rebel, and decide they're going to destroy the ecosculpture, and bring about a new breeding program for an even better warrior caste.

Enter William T. Riker, captain of the _U.S.S. Titan_. He's not in the business of letting innocent planets get turned into the Gorn's idea of the Garden of Eden. But the Hranrarii are pre-warp, so he can't pop down and tell them what's going on. Truly, he is stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Author Michael A. Martin is also the co-author of the first two Titan books, and the co-creator of the entire series. So I was cautiously optimistic this could be a solid read. But alas, this book is far from solid. 

Firstly, it's too long. Not because there are plenty of twists and turns, but because the book is annoyingly repetitive. Every chapter rehashes the current crisis, and the reader is reminded of just what's at stake (the Hranrarii), and what the weapon can do (_it can create life, but it's a terrible weapon too! Oh, what to do, what to do..._) 

Over and over again, we're constantly reminded of the predicament they're in.

The second major issue is that the muddy-soup of Gorn characters are nearly impossible to tell apart, mainly because their names are so similar. Let's see, as far as Gorn characters go, we have Gog’resssh, Rreszsesrr, Sazssgrerrn, Z’shezhira, Zegrroz’rh, S’syrixx, S’alath... okay that last one is actually the name of a Gorn ship. Anyway, it's nearly impossible to remember who is who, since their names may as well be Sue, Susan, Sue-Anne, Suzy and Suzane. 

Or, we want the names to be a little more alien: S'ue, Su'san, Sue'nne, Suz'y and Su'z'a'ne... (apostrophes make everything sound alien).

It's not all bad though. Michael A. Martin was obviously tasked with expanding the Gorn, who has only appeared in one episode of _Sar Trek: The Original Series_. He does a decent job, as we learn that the Gorn as split into castes, and their children are born and raised in carefully produced hatcheries. 

The opening chapter of the book showed a lot of promise, and the overall story is not a bad one. The book just badly needed to be cut down and re-edited. At 120 000 words, it's a longish book (by tie-in standards). It could have been 20k words shorter, and still be a satisfying length. But as it is, somehow the book felt both rushes and overly long.

James Swallow's excellent Titan novel _Synthesis_ did a much better job with Titan's diverse cast of characters. Swallow showed us a lot more interaction between sets of characters, giving us a chance to get to know them a little better. But with _Seize The Fire_, most of the characters are reduced to a few quippy one-liners, followed by them lamenting the tricky situation they find themselves in.
