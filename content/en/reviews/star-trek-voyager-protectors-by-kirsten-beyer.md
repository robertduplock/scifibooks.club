Kirsten Beyer is back with yet another *Star Trek: Voyager* novel. Protectors finds Admiral Janeway sent back to Earth for psych evaluations as Chakotay and crew head out to re-investigate the spatial anomaly from the second season episode *Twisted*, in which Voyager encounters an anomaly which twists and distorts the ship's internal layout.

**Spoilers ahead**

Believe it or not, the aforementioned *Twisted* is actually one of my favourite *Voyager* episodes. And yes, I realise I am in the minority on this one. *Twisted*, for me, exemplifies the goofy charm of the early *Voyager* episodes. Maybe it's just the nostalgia speaking, but I really enjoyed that particular episode.

So I was curious and excited to see the crew revisit the source of the spatial anomaly/life form — as Harry has finally decoded all that info it dumped into *Voyager's* main computer. They head out that way, only to find a region of space that appears to be cloaked. What seems like a dead end turns out to be a hidden planet filled with pre-warp life in desperate need of help. 

As it turns out, the life form from *Twisted* is a kind of semi-sentient, programmable thing that was created by another race that ruthlessly mined these planets for their resources, and killing whoever happened to be living there in the process. 

In a last minute act of defiance, these *proctors* (as they are now called in the book) attempt to assuage their guilty consciences by transporting some of the surviving, living beings onto an ark planet. 

I have to admit... I felt a little let down. Although it was an interesting story in and of itself, it didn't really feel connected to the episode that inspired it. In fact, it felt as though Beyer had a cool idea for a story, and retrospectively shoehorned in the *Twisted* connection. 

Following on from the previous novel, I expected Admiral Janeway to be in charge of the fleet at this point. However, she is called back to Earth to seek counselling and deal with some tricky politics. Ok, sure — she was assimilated by the Borg, and then she was dead — and then minute she came back to life she saw hundreds die and the world nearly end. So fair enough, maybe she needed a minute to catch her breath before being given command.

I get that Kirsten Beyer never gives us an easy win. After all this waiting, we still don't get to see Janeway in command. Instead, she reconnects with her mother and discovers the joys of gardening. Yes, really. While I did enjoy many of the Janeway scenes, the whole thing did feel at times like a transitionary novel. A book between books, designed to tie two bigger story arcs together.
