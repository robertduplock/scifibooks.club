A year is a long time. That's how long Michael Burnham was trapped in the 32nd century before Discovery and her crew finally emerged from the cosmic soup of space & time. So, what did Michael get up to during that year — E.g. the gap between season 3 episode 1 and season 3 episode 2? 

<!--more-->

It's easy to feel as though a whole year has slinked by, and often I find myself looking back at years end and thinking, *where did the time go?* This is not the case if you're name is Michael Burnham. In *Wonderlands*, Michael burns as brightly as ever, always trying to help, putting her nose into places, and sniffing around — whether she is welcome to or not.

After Michael is saved (well, sort of) by Cleveland "Book" Booker, she finds herself catching up with Sahil, who has been keeping a remote federation outpost alive almost singlehandedly. There, she meets Jeremiah, who agrees to help her retrieve some info from her broken tricorder. In the meantime, Michael needs something to do, so Book agrees to help her get into the courier trade.

There is some tension between the trio of Michael, Sahil and Book. Sahil represents the old way of doing things, while Book represents the new — and Michael finds herself pulled in both directions. She has fallen down the rabbit hole, and she struggles to understand her role in this brave new world.

The book's title, *Wonderlands*, references Alice in Wonderland. Michael names her small courier ship *Alice,* and there are several other references dotted throughout the book. Like Alice in Alice in Wonderland, Michael finds herself overwhelmed by a strange new world that she doesn't understand. No Federation, no Starfleet, no dilithium to power the warp drives — and so she turns to the people around her to provide guidance. 

I loved Una McCormack's prequel novel [The Last Best Hope](https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-picard-the-last-best-hope-book-review/), so I had high hopes for this one. And although Wonderlands is a great book, it somehow didn't quite impress me as much as her Picard prequel. 

*Wonderlands* has many positive attributes. It's well written, entertaining and remains true to the tone of the show. McCormack, as usual, displays an impressive grasp of the on-screen characters and perfectly translates them down to the page. But my one small issue with the book is its pacing. *Wonderlands* crams in a hell of a lot of story into a single book, and often the reader simply gets a summary of something without being able to experience it. 

This was probably a conscious choice on McCormack's behalf. Discovery is a twisty, thrill-a-minute show, and Michael is often rash and impulsive, always going at a hundred miles an hour. The pace of Wonderlands very much reflects this — the storyline at times feels rash and impulsive, with a lot of side quests and mini-stories that wrap up quickly before rushing into the next.

For example, there is a scene in which Book is taken captive and Michael has to bust him out. The actual jailbreak could have been an entire chapter — perhaps 5000 words or so — but the whole thing is summarised in 50 words or less. It is the nature of narrative fiction that the writer picks and chooses which parts of the story to examine up close, and which parts to skip over. The problem can be that, when so much story is crammed in, it can feel like too much is getting skipped over.

As I said, a year is a long time. And Michael Burnham, true to character, did not stay still for an entire year — and *Wonderlands* reflects this. And as I reflect on the book, I feel more and more that the pacing of the book was quite deliberate and actually quite well suited. We really do experience the full year. Yes, it is a wild ride. But undercutting all the action with the White Palm, Vanguard and everything else Michael gets muddled up in, we also experience the loneliness Michael feels, and the melancholy as she finds old personal logs recorded as the burn took place. We see how the complex relationship between Michael and Book evolved — they have a lot of fun together, but somehow their destinies just don't seem quite aligned. 

That brings me to one other minor point and something I love about Una McCormack — she actually uses the classic Star Trek logs in her books. E.g. "*Personal log, Michael Burnham, stardate....*" This is such a great device for filling in the blanks around a story, and a classic part of Star Trek on screen, it's weird how few writers use these log entries in the books.

Overall, *Wonderlands* is another example of just how good Star Trek literature has become. It's fun, thoughtful — quite funny in parts, yet bittersweet and melancholy in others. I think Una McCormack did a great job with this one.
