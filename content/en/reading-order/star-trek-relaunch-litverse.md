This is a sensible reading order to the Star Trek books set after the finales for The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine & Voyager.

It includes crossovers and various spin-offs such as Titan & Section 31.

***Relaunch*** books are set after the final TV episode (or movie) but are not yet part of the shared "litverse".

***Litverse*** books share a common literary universe. E.g. What happens in a Deep Space Nine book may affect The Next Generation or Voyager crews in a subsequent novel.
