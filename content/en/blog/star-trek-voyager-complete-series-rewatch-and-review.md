Recently, I did a rewatch of _Star Trek: Voyager_. From _Caretaker_ to _Endgame_, it was quite a journey through the delta quadrant. Now, more than 20 years since the series finale, I have a few thoughts I'd like to share.

I have a bit of a mixed history with Voyager. I watched the show when it first aired. Here in Australia, it aired every Thursday, 11pm, on channel 9. I was just 12-13 years old, when I watched the premier double episode, _Caretaker_. Up until that point, I'd been a casual, newish fan of _The Original Series_, which I liked mainly for its fun, retro aesthetic and creative plotlines.

_Voyager_ was the new, shiny Trek. Each Thursday night I'd set the VCR to timer-record the show on VHS tape. As the show continued on, I missed a few episodes here and there. I watched a fair bit of it, but never saw it through to the end. I'm not sure it was just my tumultuous teenage years getting int the way, or if chanell 9 stopped airing the show. Either way, Voyager was an unfinished chapter for me. I never knew if or how the crew made their way home.

Many years later, as a casual Trek fan, I discovered _The Next Generation_. Despite the shaky first couple of seasons, I grew to like, then really like, then love the show. TNG remains for me the pinacle of Trek. At it's best, TNG was in a league of its own.

Once TNG ended, I had a starship sized hole in my life. I watched most of _Deep Space 9_, but struggled to click with the show (to this day it remains my least favourite Trek). Then I moved onto Voyager. The first double episode, although not perfect, was still a cracker, and kicked things off in a big way. Stranded 75 light years from home, in an unexplored region of the Galaxy, this ragtag group of Starfleet personell and Marqui rebels would have to work together to find their way home.

... and so, the most common criticism of _Voyager_ laid itself bare before my eyes. Many people complain that the show failed to fullfil it's premise. Just a few episodes in, everyone is getting along just fine. The Marqui rebels are now part of the crew. Edgy characters find their edges filed down to a smooth curve. Rick Berman, the infamous produce of Voyager, famously stated that audiences would soon tire of an intra-ship conflict between the two sides. _Translation_: Hit the status quo early and start churning out some seriously vanilla Trek.

The show quickly settles into monster-of-the-week storytelling. Fans bemoaned the show's tendency to re-use elements from it's precedessor, _The Next Generation_. "Recycled storylines" is often cited as a criticism. But what I found more annoying for the subtler similarities in character. For instance, The Doctor is obviously _Voyager_'s Data. Two artificial intelligences striving to be more human. But where Data plays classical violin, The Doctor sings opera. _Wow, so different!_ Similarly, where Captain Picard likes to drink plenty of "Tea, earl grey, hot" â€” Captain Janeway drinks black coffee. _Wow, so different!_

Novelist Brandon Sanderson, in his excellent lecture series on storytelling, breaks the three act structure of a story into three main areas: Promises, Progress and Payoff. Using this as a framework, it's easy to see why Voyager struggled to keep a strong audience. 

#### Promises

Voyager started off by offering it's audience an exciting set of promises. Two waring sides, Starfleet and Marqui, are thrust into the delta quadrant, and must work through their differences to find a way home. It sounds cool, right? Except, the show then _breaks_ this promise. As mentioned above, within just a few episodes one can't tell a Marqui from Starfleet. Characters like Tom Paris and B'elanna are promised to be edgy, intransigent characters. Instead, Tom becomes a cuddly teddybear and B'elanna, half Klingon, barely raised her voice even once.
