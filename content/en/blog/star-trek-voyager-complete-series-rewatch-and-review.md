title = "Star Trek: Voyager complete series rewatch and review"

Recently, I did a rewatch of _Star Trek: Voyager_. From _Caretaker_ to _Endgame_, it was quite a journey through the delta quadrant. Now, more than 20 years since the series finale, I have a few thoughts I'd like to share.

I have a bit of a mixed history with Voyager. I watched the show when it first aired. Here in Australia, it aired every Thursday, 11pm, on channel 9. I was just 12-13 years old, when I watched the premier double episode, _Caretaker_. Up until that point, I'd been a casual, newish fan of _The Original Series_, which I liked mainly for its fun, retro aesthetic and creative plotlines. 

Voyager was the new, shiny Trek.
