Confused about all the Star Trek books? Confused by all the terms: Relaunch, litverse, post-Nemesis continuity? Not sure where and how to start reading Treklit? This article is a simple explainer.

There a lot of Star Trek books. And I mean, _a lot_. For many years, Trek novels where simply original works of fiction, based on the show (TOS, TNG etc). They were self contained books, and set during the course of the TV series. Sometimes they'd even say: "The following story takes place shortly after episode X". Each story was signed off by CBS marketing, or whoever owned Star Trek at the time, to ensure the books wouldn't contradict the show; past, present or future.

But, by the mid 2000s, the Star Trek franchise was dead in the water. _Star Trek: Nemesis_ had bombed at the cinema. _Star Trek: Enterprise_ was cancelled after just 4 seasons. _Deep Space 9_ and _Voyager_ had finished up their run, and no further sequels, movies or spinoffs were planned.

At this time, CBS marketing (or whoever) loosened their guidelines around Trek books. For the first time, the books could now continue the events of the TV series after it's final episode or movie. E.g. If you have ever wanted to know what happened after _Voyager_ made it back to earth, you can read: _Star Trek: Voyager: Homecoming_. The book is set immediately after the series finale Endgame, and continues the story on. The next book continued on from that book, and so on.

* **Deep Space 9**:
  * The books "_Avatar Part 1 & 2_", published in 2001, continue the story after the DS9 series finale.
* **Voyager**
  * The books "_Homecoming_" and "_The Farther Shore_", published in 2003, continue the story after the VOY series finale.

Things get a bit more complicated though. in 2005, it was time for _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ to get to the relaunch treatment. The first TNG relaunch title was _Death in Winter_, published in 2005. However, in the same year, they also published _Star Trek: Titan: Taking Wing_, which was a TNG spinoff, in which Riker is now captain on the USS Titan (referenced in the movie Nemesis), alongside Troi and Tuvok.

At this point, both book series would run in parallel, existing in a shared universe. _Voyager_ and _Deep Space 9_ were still continuing there "relaunch" stories independently. But, of course, all three series were, chronilogically speaking, taking place at the same time, in the same universe.

Eventually, _Voyager_ and _Deep Space 9_'s relaunch books were "merged" into the shared universe set up by TNG and Titan. Furthermore, there were additional spin-offs and crossovers that were set in this "litverse" or "post-Nemesis shared continuity". These include one-shot books such as _Star Trek: Articles of the Federation_ and _Star Trek: A Singular Destiny._ Also, _Star Trek: Department of Temporal Investigations_ and _Star Trek: Section 31_.

Confused yet? The hardest part is finding out some kind of logical order in which to read them. Luckily, there are two awesome resources online.

If you just want a dead simple list to follow, with a list of books set out in a sensible order, check out: https://startreklitverse.com/simple-post-nemesis-reading-list.php

However, as I've read along with a dozen or so books, it's become obvious that there is no exact order in which they must be read. Many books run roughly parallel to each other and have fairly independent stories. If you prefer to pick and choose a bit, while generally following a sensible reading order, I recommend: https://www.shastrix.com/books/star-trek-reading-order.php

Of course, this line of books does not nicely match up to the new _Star Trek: Picard_. So if you read these books, understand that they are one possible timeline of events. That being said, the last three books in the series, a trilogy named _Coda_, may tie up the loose ends somehow.

The last thing I will say is kudos to the Star Trek publishers Simon & Schuster / Pocket Books for giving the writers a chance to wrap up the post-Nemesis relaunch/litverse book series. Star Wars tie-in lit was in a similar position, and Disney just cut the book series, without a satisfying resolution, once the new movies came out. So good on them for giving readers a proper ending!
