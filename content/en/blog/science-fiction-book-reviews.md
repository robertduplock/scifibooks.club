+++
At Sci-fi Books Club, we are all about reviewing science fiction books. We read the classics, new releases and everything in between. We love everything from the pulpy B-grade space opera classics — to the newer, more literary outings.

When we're not busy reviewing books, we like to read other reviews too! There are a lot of novels out there, many more than we could possibly review even if we lived as long as Leto II. So, here are a few of our favourite sites:

1. [SFF World](https://www.sffworld.com/)

We like SFF world because they are prolific, releasing a new review about once a week. They also have a lively discussion forum! They're a great place for new releases, but not so much the classics. 

2. [At Boundary's Edge](https://atboundarysedge.com/)

What can I say — these guys have a similar taste in books to us! Star Trek, Dune and Foundation are all covered here, and plenty more too. ABE also has a love for the pulpy Baen publications, which we adore. Good stuff!

3. [SciFi Chick](https://scifichick.com/)

Part review site, part geeky blog, SciFi Chick is always a fun read. She/they engage in all kinds of nerd related fun, while still offering plenty of book reviews. Plus they do quite a few giveaways for a reasonably small blog. 

4. [Unreality SF](http://unreality-sf.net/)

Probably the prettiest site on this list, Unreality SF tends to focus a bit more on the screen, but if you dig into the site a bit you will find a plethora of high-quality book reviews. They have a particular love of tie-in fiction, which is a lot of fun.

So there you have it, folks, four awesome sites offering great book reviews, to help you find your next great read. So many books... never enough reading time...
