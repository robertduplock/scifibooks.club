Star Trek: Picard has certainly divided fans of the enduring sci-fi franchise. Some hate it, some love it... and some, like me, are somewhere in between. Personally, I enjoyed season 1, although it certainly had its flaws, particularly the last two episodes. Will season 2 fare any better?

**Major spoilers ahead!**

<!-- more -->

It seems that season 2 isn't much of a follow-on from season 1. XBs, Romulan spies and all that business are left in the past... er, I mean left in the future, as the intrepid crew time-travel back to 2024 to fix an issue with the timeline.

Timey-wimey story alert!

The S2 storyline quickly fractures into multiple story threads, so I thought I might divide and conquer by addressing each separately.

### Picard deals with his past

It was sort of interesting to find out the history of Picard's parents. It turns out Jean-Luc blamed himself for the death of his mother and vilified his father in turn. Apparently, the point of this series was for Picard to forgive himself. But the dream sequence episode was awful and felt a lot like filler.

### Crazy capers with Seven and Raffi

I've got no problem with the Raffi/Seven relationship, but this story thread didn't gel for me. I just don't think the pair have much chemistry, and the constant bickering was more annoying than entertaining. Raffi was too unhinged and came off somewhat unlikeable. 

### Agnes is the new Borg Queen

Many folks over at Trek BBS seemed to love this aspect of the show, but for me, I must just be a bit Borged out. The Borg have been transformed from an unstoppable juggernaut to a sad, lonely girl scared of being alone. 

### Renee Picard and the Watcher

"Hey, guys, look... we're five episodes in, and we're running out of story. How about Picard's niece is also an astronaut, and all of future history hinges on her getting on that ship?" The primary issue with this story thread is that, basically, nothing happens. Not-Laris sits around in different rooms, talking a lot, while Renee gets a pep-talk from Picard. Although the bit at the end where Not-Laris saves her was a neat little twist.

### Rios and the Doctor

Somehow, Rios emerged as my favourite character in season 2. Rios never quite fit into the 24th century, a man out of place. I liked how he found his groove in the barbaric past. He and the doctor had good chemistry, and I enjoyed the "heart on sleeve" social commentary regarding the treatment of immigrants and refugees. However, I am bummed they left him behind.

### Q is about to go zzzzzz

Q was teased as a significant part of the story, but he is barely in it! Fine, the final scene with him and Picard was pretty touching. I just wish he (and Guinan, to some extent) played a more pivotal role in the story. John De Lance was great, though.

### Play me another Soong

At this point, I'm just tired. I love Brent Spiner, but this Soong iteration winds up being a one-dimensional bad guy, and the story was Kore was a re-hash from season 1. In some ways, this might have been the weakest point in the show. Seriously, you don't need _seven_ plot threads to fill ten episodes. They wanted to cast Spiner and Briones in the show somehow.
