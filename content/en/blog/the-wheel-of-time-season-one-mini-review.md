_The Wheel of Time_. Many years ago I tried to read the first instalment. It had been recommended to me by a friend, and I'll be honest here — I found _The Eye of the World_ to be a painfully boring read. It was slow, and I just didn't connect with any of the characters. I forced myself to the halfway point and then gave up. 

**From here be spoilers!**

When Amazon announced they were planning a TV adaption, I wasn't particularly excited. However, my wife and I watched the first episode on a whim. We were both pleasantly surprised by the first episode. The costume and set design looked great, there was plenty of action, and Rosamund Pike ruled the screen as the powerful Aes Sedai character Moiraine Damodred. Daniel Henney also stood out, playing the laconic Lan Mandragoran. 

So far so good.

The rest of the cast was... okay. Perrin and Rand came across as a little dull, and Nynaeve a little annoying. The best of the rest was definitely Barney Harris as Mat Cauthon — and if you've watched the show you've probably realised that he quit partway through the production, and his character was temporarily written out of season 1 so he could be recast.

Online, I came across plenty of people moaning and groaning about the show being too _woke_. 

> **WOKE:** is aware of and actively attentive to important facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice).

Yes, many of the cast aren't white. But seriously the show was a lot less woke than people online would have you believe. The powerful Aes Sedai are all women, just as they were in the books. Some of the characters probably weren't black or brown in the books — but seriously, it's 2022. Who cares if they cast an actor who doesn't 100% fit the description from the book, as long as they embody the personality.

Critics of the show labelled it The Woke of Time, including renounced author Neal Asher.

Yikes. Who knew Neal was a middle-aged white guy who likes to complain about there not being enough white people on the small screen?
