### 2381 — U.S.S. Aventine

#### CHAPTER #1

<!--more-->

Standing on holodeck 4, you’d never know that the warm sunshine was nothing but a trick of the light. Captain Ezri Dax wriggled her toes in the short-cut grass below. Manicured gardens, rich with red and white foliage, surrounded the neatly mowed lawn in which she and six others now waited. At the front of the pack stood Sam Bowers, her XO and friend. He grinned with expectation.

“Welcome to the _Aventine_’s first-ever handstand class.” A soft murmur rose from the six people gathered before her. She continued, “Handstands have many benefits. They’re great for improving balance and building upper body strength. They keep you agile and get your blood pumping. But most importantly of all, they’re just plain fun to do.”

Bowers chuckled and said, “What made you want to share your secret superpower with us mere mortals?”

“We’ve had a tough run of it lately,” Dax said. “I need this crew to be at its best. That means keeping fit, staying healthy, and occasionally having a little fun.” The diminutive Trill woman stepped into the small crowd before her, splitting them sideways. “Everyone take a big step back and watch me.”

Dax leaned in and tipped herself over, performing a textbook handstand. She could smell the grass, her nose just inches away from the plush green ground, as she performed the handstand.

Righting herself, she straightened her Starfleet uniform and dusted her hands. “Easy as that.”

The crowd chuckled. Sam said, “Easy for you does not mean easy for us.”

“Don’t worry, I’ll break it down for you all.”

Dax demonstrated her technique one step at a time. All eyes were locked on her as she ran them through how to stand initially, the movement of tipping over onto stretched-out arms and how to balance. “It’s a smooth motion, not a lunge,” she said. “Keep your arms straight as you approach the ground. Let the momentum carry you, and then straighten your legs and aim them towards the big blue up there.”

Gymnastics was a part of Ezri Dax. As a joined Trill, she had all the memories and life experiences of all her former hosts. In previous incarnations, Ezri Dax had lived as a scientist, a diplomat, a musical composer and a politician. But right now, it was Emony who quelled from deep within. Emony was a gymnast, so performing a handstand was no big deal.

Presently, Dax walked around the circle and helped everyone, one by one. Lieutenant Naomi Darrow nearly headbutted the ground on her first attempt, but Dax helped her work through the movements. The portly Bolian Lieutenant Tharp seemed unable to commit to the full range of motion and required some encouragement to overcome his hesitation. The young Erin Constantino was not short on enthusiasm, deciding that constant repetition was an excellent way to learn something rather than focusing on form. Dax gently encouraged Constantino to slow down and concentrate on what her body was doing. The ensign nodded and grinned, evidently enjoying herself.

So far, the only person who’d managed to make their handstand stick was Commander Sam Bowers. She’d known him since her days on Deep Space Nine, and her heart was warmed by the fact he’d made the effort to come along, even though it probably wasn’t typically his idea of a good time. Plus, he was already pretty good at handstands.

As she approached Bowers, he performed a near-perfect handstand, walking around on his hands while his feet reached for the sky. He said, “If my legs give out, I can always get about like this.”

“Impressive,” Dax said with a smile, feeling a bead of sweat drip from her brow. “If you ever retire from Starfleet, gymnastics could be your next gig.”

Bowers tumbled over and landed on his rump. A cheeky grin covered his handsome, ebony face. He said, “I was thinking something more like a circus performer. I’m sure there is a circus troop making their way around the deep space stations, delighting the locals.”

“You would make an excellent clown.”

A gentle breeze tickled the side of Dax’s face as she moved away from Sam, ensuring others got their share of her attention. She didn’t want to look like she favoured the more senior crew.

Slowly, one by one, everyone except Tharp could perform something resembling a handstand. Dax stood in front of him and said, “Step forward and lean into it. I’ll catch your legs.”

“Really?” he asked, a little breathless.

“Just try not to kick your commanding officer in the face.”

Everyone turned to look at the pair. Dax cringed. She hadn’t meant to draw attention to the one person who was struggling. A warm sensation worked its way up into her cheeks. She swallowed and said, “There is no harm in trying.”

The lieutenant rubbed the nape of his neck. “My mind is willing, but I can’t guarantee my body will follow.” He stepped forward, leaned into it, stretched out his arms and kicked with his legs. Two flailing ankles shot towards her.

Dax felt her hands naturally move to intercept Tharp’s ankles — grabbing just above his boots. She held him in the air, and a moment later, everyone was clapping. The portly Bolian was upside down and doing a handstand… with a bit of help. While she held him by the ankles, her combadge chirruped. Instinctively, she let go, tapped her badge and said, “Dax here.”

Tharp tumbled over. _Wump!_

“_Captain, you have an incoming transmission from Starfleet HQ._” The voice belonged to ops manager Gaff chim Nak, who was currently on the bridge.

Dax crouched down to check Tharp was okay. The Bolian smiled, and she mouthed to word _sorry._ Aloud, she said, “Pipe it through to me here, Lieutenant.”

Gaff chim Nak’s husky voice responded, “_I believe Starfleet admirals prefer to keep their conversations private, rather than piped through the speakers of a holodeck for everyone to hear._”

Dax felt her heart skip a beat. “Right. Send it through to my ready room. And maybe beam me straight there. And replicate a cool towel.”

“_Anything else?_”

“Would you consider taking over my handstand class?”

***

A few moments later, Dax found herself surrounded by shimmering particles of light, and then she was in her ready room. A white towel waited for her on her desk. It was pleasantly cool to the touch when she gave herself a quick wipe down before tapping her console and bringing the Admiral online.

The face that appeared on the screen was instantly recognisable — Admiral Akaar. Famous for his tall body and a short fuse, Akaar was not known to mince words. He gave her a cold smile and said, “Am I interrupting something?”

Dax composed herself. “Sorry to keep you waiting, Admiral. I was putting the old Earth adage ‘healthy body, healthy mind’ into practice.”

The imposing Capellan admiral raised an eyebrow. “I’m afraid you’ll need to put your fitness plans on hold for the moment. We have an urgent mission for you.”

Nodding, Dax said, “No problem, Admiral. What are the details?”

“_During the Borg invasion, a lot of our ships fell off the map. People scattered. We’ve been doing our best to find survivors — any survivors. Starfleet just intercepted a weak subspace distress call from the_ U.S.S. Sequeira_. Heard of it?_”

With a frown, Dax said, “It doesn’t ring any particular bell for me.”

“_I’d be surprised if it did. The_ Sequeira _started off life as a small science vessel but was hastily refitted as a warship during the invasion. All the crew were soft-headed boffins, some of them civilians. Like so many others, they had to pick up a pitchfork and march to the frontlines during the war. Anyway, they’re badly damaged and trapped in a subspace distortion anomaly — probably the result of the collapsed transwarp conduits the Borg were so fond of._”

“It sounds like their time is running out,” Dax said, “and you need slipstream velocities to reach them.”

“_Correct,_” Akaar said. “_We have ships closer than yours, but even so, you can get there the fastest._”

Ezri’s ship, the _U.S.S. Aventine,_ was one of only a handful of ships equipped with a quantum slipstream drive. This latest and greatest form of propulsion was still considered experimental, although no doubt soon enough, it would be standard issue across the fleet, replacing the older style warp engines.

“_I’m sending you the coordinates now. A word of warning, though. They’re trapped right on the edge of Federation space. Many salvagers and junk traders have been hovering around the edges of our territory, picking at the bones of war, hoping to find a little meat. Right now, the Federation does not need any new enemies. We need diplomats, not cowboys with their hands hovering by their phasers._”

“Understood,” Dax said. Her mouth was slowly going dry. She eyed a glass of water on her table and took a small sip before continuing. “We’ll do our best to keep our torpedo bays locked, and our phasers powered down.”

“_One other thing,_” Akaar said. The big man cleared his throat. “_What the Federation also needs, right now, is a few good news stories. Spirits are low, and we’re worried that some may lose faith in our ways. Bring these men and women home, Captain Dax. That’s an order._”

Dax licked her dry lips. “Sounds like we better get moving.”

Akaar gave a curt nod on the video screen. “Akaar out.”

Stealing a precious moment for herself, Dax leaned back into her chair and let out a long breath. She’d had a few admirals barking orders at her during the war, but when an armada of cubes filled to the brim with dead-eyed drones was heading your way — well, a grumpy admiral or two didn’t seem so bad. But now, in peacetime, a call from a Starfleet admiral was a little intimidating.

Her mind turned to the mission she’d been given. _I steered this ship through the invasion,_ she thought. _I can handle a simple rescue mission._

Dax stood and marched through the sliding doors and onto the bridge. She heard the soft murmur of bridge chatter fall into silence. To her right, the turbolift doors opened. Commander Bowers stepped onto the bridge and gave her a subtle nod as he headed for his chair. She also noted Tharp had returned from the holodeck. He sat at the navigational console, a sleek shimmer of sweat still on his blue skin.

“We have a mission,” Dax said to the room. “There is a vessel stranded on the edge of Federation space, and our spiffy little ship can reach them first. Mister Tharp, please calculate a course for these coordinates.” She transferred the numbers Akaar had given her to Tharp’s navigational controls. “And don’t forget to carry the one — we’re in a bit of a hurry.”

“Aye,” he said.

Next, Dax tapped her commbadge. “Bridge to engineering.”

“_Leishman here,_” came the response. Mikaela Leishman, like Bowers, was another carry-over from Deep Space Nine.

“Chief, I need our best possible speed and then a little more if you can manage it. We’re on a rescue mission, and I don’t intend to be the bearer of bad news to any of their families any time soon.”

“_Understood_,” Leishman said. “_I’ll unleash my hoard of highly trained tribbles into the slipstream now. They’ll keep it running smoothly._”

“Whatever it takes, Mikaela. Dax out.”

Taking a seat in the captain’s chair, she stared at the viewscreen — nothing much to see, other than a blanket of stars winking softly. Tharp turned to her and said, “Course calculated and plotted, and we have the thumbs up from engineering.”

The voice of Lonnoc Kedair came from behind. “These coordinates are the edge of Federation space. The very outer edge, at that.” The tough Tarkaran woman breathed through her nose. “There could be some trouble lurking in these waters.”

“Let’s keep our weapons holstered for the moment, Lieutenant. But we should be prepared for the fact that not everyone may welcome our visit.”

“Very well,” Lonnoc said.

Dax checked the ship’s vitals on her chair’s side panel. A series of green lights flashed across a diagram of the _Aventine_. All systems looked good.

“Let’s do this,” Dax said. “Engage.”

#### Chapter #2

The _U.S.S. Aventine_ engaged its engines and shot into the slipstream corridor, riding a wave of quantum fluctuations as it zipped towards its destination coordinates. From the soft hum that filled the bridge, Dax sensed that the slipstream drive was performing nicely.

“Mr Tharp,” Dax said, “what’s our ETA to the Federation’s fence line?”

“Three hours and fourteen minutes, Captain.”

Dax leaned over the edge of her chair and spoke to Sam in a hushed voice. “Join me in my ready room.”

The door to her ready room hushed open, and she made straight for the food replicator. “_Raktajino_, hot.” The rich, intense smell of the Klingon _raktajino_ filled her nostrils. It evoked a deep sense of place and memory.

“Feeling tired?” Sam asked, standing beside a high-backed chair. She motioned for him to take a seat.

“It never hurts to be a little more alert,” Ezri said, cupping the hot drink in her hands. “I think Jadzia was a fan of these, along with half the crew of Deep Space Nine. Have you tried one?”

“Not a big fan of caffeine,” Sam said. “I like to keep things natural.”

“The old me was a bit that way. The _joined_ me…” Dax shrugged.

Sam crossed his legs. “Anything on your mind, Cap?”

Dax placed the mug on the desk. “Was the handstand class a silly idea?”

Her XO laughed. “Not at all. Everyone was grateful for the change of pace. The invasion is over — we came first, and the Borg came second. We can’t just sit around licking our sores.”

With a nod, Dax said, “I was hoping a few more people might have shown up. And I feel a bit bad about Tharp’s tumble.”

“Bad timing,” Sam said and shrugged.

Taking another sip of the _raktajino,_ Dax felt the hot liquid slip down her throat. She said, “Every time I see a Starfleet admiral pop up on my video screen, I’m certain they’re calling to tell me that a real Starfleet captain is en route to take over the _Aventine_.” She paused and stared into her drink. “Some people spend their entire life trying to make captain. I somehow got there almost by accident and on a ship with a slipstream drive!”

Sam chided her gently. “You earned your rank during the Borg invasion. We all earned our ranks. I’ll tell you the one thing this ship doesn’t deserve — and that’s a Captain who let’s imposter syndrome and her self doubts get in the way.”

Dax felt her mouth dry out. “That’s harsh but fair.”

“I didn’t mean you can’t talk to me about those things. That’s at least ten per cent of my job. But when you’re on the bridge, you’ve always handled yourself with grace and style. Whatever’s bubbling underneath, you’re cool and calm under pressure. You have lifetimes of experience under your belt. Trust me, you got this.”

A smile warmed Dax’s face. “Thanks, Sam. Since you offered to be my listening post, my other major insecurity is that the only reason Starfleet haven’t stripped my field commission is a positive bias in favour of joined Trills. With so many past lives living inside of me, perhaps they’ve mistaken life experience for command experience.”

Running a hand over his short crop of tight curls, Sam said, “It’s not a bad thing to identify your insecurities. Self-awareness is important, as long as you balance it. Positive and negative.”

She finished off her _raktajino_. “Sounds like the handstand classes might continue then.”

“I’ll be there.”

Dax glanced at the door that led to the bridge. “Keep an eye on things out there, will you?”

“Aye.” Sam stood and took his leave.

When the doors were closed, Dax placed her Starfleet issue boots on the desk. Sam Bowers was a fine XO, and she was lucky to have him. They’d worked together, on and off, for a few years. Memories stirred inside of her. The voice of the irrepressible Curzon Dax, a former Dax host, echoed in her mind: _Being a leader is easy,_ he said, _it simply takes honesty, integrity, humility and focus_.

_You were known to spin a web of lies now and then,_ Dax thought back_. And humility isn’t the first word one might use to describe you._

Curzon snorted — a strange sound to hear in one’s own head. _Those who can’t do, teach._

As Curzon’s voice faded from her mind, Ezri Dax squared her shoulders and said aloud, “Honesty, integrity, humility and focus. I think I can manage that.”

***

“_Captain to the bridge._”

Lonnoc Kedair’s husky voice snapped Dax from her reverie. Buried in Starfleet reports, duty rosters and preparatory intel for this region of space, Dax gladly put down her padd and tapped her combadge. “On my way.”

As Dax stepped onto the bridge, Lonnoc Kedair approached. Deep cranial ridges lined the Takaran woman’s forehead, brow and upper cheekbones, casting slanted shadows across her green skin. “Captain, we will arrive at our coordinates shortly.”

Dax acknowledged her Chief of Security with a curt nod. “We made good time.” She turned to her second officer. “Mr Helkara, scan the area. Let’s find our friends.”

“Aye,” Helkara responded and tapped several commands into his console. “Nothing yet. Significant subspace distortions are interfering with our scans.”

“Can you clean it up?” Bowers asked.

“Once we’re out of the slipstream corridor, yes. For now, all I’m reading is sensor garble.”

Tharp chimed in. “Good news then, we’re slowing to impulse now.”

Dax gave Bowers a wry smile. “If we want to get the lay of the land, we can always do it the old fashioned way and look out the window.”

Sam smiled back and said, “On screen.”

Against the pitch-black night, a small starship — the _Sequeira_ — came into view. Segments of its hull were scalded and black, with hunks of metal wrenched away from their supports. Limp and lifeless, the _Sequeira_ drifted aimlessly around a subspace eddy.

“Lifesigns?” Dax asked.

“Twelve —”

Kedair’s reply was cut short by another vessel moving to intercept. The _Aventine_ rocked as the ship careened past. The thing was an ugly clump of green and grey metallic alloys, heavily armoured with a thick, reinforced hull. Its single nacelle burned a dirty red flame as it flew by.

“Someone is busting in on our rescue mission!” Sam said.

“That ship missed us by a coat of paint,” Dax said. “Who are they?”

Kedair wrangled with her tactical console before replying, “The other ship appears to be of Sidager design.”

“Sidager…” Dax said, tasting the word in her mouth, feeling for familiarity. No memories stirred. “Why are they crashing our party?”

Kedair scowled. “The Sidager are poor junk traders with hacked together ships. Technologically speaking, they’re not exactly setting the trends. But they’re aggressive and unafraid to use force.”

“Hail the Sidager vessel.”

Before she had time to take a breath, the _Aventine_’s viewscreen was flooded with an imposing alien visage — a Sidager woman. Her skin, encased in an array of brilliant white crescent-shaped scales, lined her neck, chin and cheeks — while two deeply-socketed silver eyes glared outwards. She spoke, and her deep, guttural voice filled the bridge. “_Unidentified vessel, this salvage is ours_.”

Dax spoke quickly. “I’m Captain Dax of the Federation starship _Aventine_. That ship out there is a Federation vessel stuck in —”

The screen went blank.

“Captain,” Bowers said, “Two more Sidager vessels now coming into range.”

“All ships are roughly of the same design,” Kedair noted, “One on one, we’re clear winners. One against three, and I wouldn’t be so eager to start a shooting match.”

Bower’s tapped the console mounted on his chair. “The other two ships aren’t as heavily armed as the lead ship. Sensor readings are a little weird — I think the subspace distortion isn’t helping. In any case, I don’t think they’re here for a playdate.”

Kedair said, “The lead ship is coming about, and it’s charging phasers. They’re targeting the _Sequeira_.”

Dax felt her hands grip tightly on her chair’s armrests. “Pursue the lead vessel, and put us between them and the _Sequeira._ Full impulse.”

The _Aventine_ rocked as Tharp made a quick course change, moving to put the _Aventine_ in the line of fire.

“Why would they fire on the _Sequeira_ if they plan to salvage her?” Bowers asked.

The question remained rhetorical as Dax stepped up and stood beside Lieutenant Commander Helkara. She studied the ops console. “Looks like they’re targeting life support with a tight beam phaser.” She placed a hand on Helkara’s arm and asked him directly, “Can we just beam the survivors out?”

“All this subspace distortion means we’ll probably end up with nothing but humanoid soup on the transporter pads. I wouldn’t recommend it.”

Dax winced at the soup analogy but appreciated the point. Transporters were out. She said, “Hail them again.”

“No response,” Kedair grunted.

Tharp wriggled in his chair. “Three seconds until we crash the party. Their phasers are at full charge.”

“They’re firing!” Kedair called out.

Grabbing hold of a nearby support railing, Dax felt the cold metal in her palm as she steadied herself. The _Aventine_ shook, its shields absorbing the phaser’s beam. “Status?”

“We took one for the team,” Kedair said. “The _Sequeira_ crew may yet live to fight another day. Our shields are holding at 96 per cent.”

“Hail them again,” Dax said.

A moment later, the same fierce, feminine face filled the screen. “_I admire your courage,_” she said, “_but we outnumber you and outgun you. This is your last warning. We claim this salvage._”

“Wait,” Dax said, mentally uttering a quick, silent prayer that the viewscreen wouldn’t go blank. “We aren’t here to claim salvage. The people on that ship — the one you’re firing on — they are our friends. We’re the rescue team.”

The Sidager woman looked like she’d just bitten a raw _Syto_ bean. “You are a Federation vessel?”

“Yes,” Dax said. “As I said —“

“_The Federation border is about six_ ki’mi _in that direction_,” she motioned with what looked like a secondary opposable thumb. “_I suggest you skulk back there_.”

Again, the screen went blank. Dax said, “Mr Tharp, keep us between them and the _Sequeira_. We protect that vessel at all costs. Understood?”

“Aye,” Tharp said.

Bowers clicked his tongue. “The other two ships are arming their torpedo bays, and the lead ship is powering up for a serious light show. I don’t know if we can take hits from three different directions. Our shields aren’t _that_ good.”

“Target the weapons on the lead ship,” Dax said. “Fire!”

The viewscreen showed a thick bolt of red light shooting towards the Sidager ship. A small eruption exploded on its port side. “Direct hit!” Kedair said.

“The other two ships will be in range in about twenty seconds,” Bowers said.

Dax stood and snapped out an order. “Bring all three ships up on the main view screen. I want visuals.”

Helkara tapped her console, and the viewscreen split into thirds. On each, a different Sidager ship was displayed. Bowers gave a low whistle and said, “They don’t look like much. But according to these scans, they sure pack a punch.”

Chewing the inside of her lip, Dax asked, “Is it possible they’re using the subspace distortions to hide a projection of false sensor readings?”

Gaff chim Nak answered from the science station. “The integrity of our scanning data is highly questionable. The other two ships could be nothing but unarmed freighters, projecting a few sensor shadows and pretending to be a whole lot scarier than they really are.”

“Conjecture will get us nowhere,” Kedair said. “We can’t confidently protect the _Sequeira_ from three ships coming in from three different angles.”

“Lieutenant Tharp,” Dax said, “launch two sensor probes, targeted at each incoming Sidager vessel.”

Tharp hesitated for a brief moment before answering, “Yes, ma’am. Sensor probes away.”

“The ships are now within firing range,” Kedair called out. “Can I at least fire a warning shot?”

Dax gave a curt nod. “Three warning shots — simultaneously across the bow of each vessel.”

The _Aventine_ rumbled as its phasers burst into action. Each shot skidded past the hull of the incoming ships.

There was a short silence, which Bowers interrupted. “The sensor probes are returning data.”

“And?” Dax asked.

Bowers snorted. “We called their bluff. These ships could barely beat me up for my lunch money, let alone take on the _Aventine_. Their so-called weapons are nothing but thoron fields and duranium shadows. They’re clever, but it turns out that they’re not well armed.”

“Hail them one more time. I think they might be ready to talk.”
