### 2382 — U.S.S. Aventine

<!--more-->

Seated in her ready room, Captain Ezri Dax counted the number of padds lined up on her desk. Sixteen. She leaned forward in her chair and pulled the first one from the top. Due 1600 hours: Captain’s report pertaining to the recent incursion along the Breen border. Starfleet priority order six.

She sighed and picked up the next padd. “Why can’t they consolidate these report requests into the same padd?” she asked, although no one was around to hear the question, much less answer it. Standing, she took a moment to stretch. Her body felt like a coiled spring.

Dax looked studied the interior of the captain’s ready room. Her ready room. During the terrible and bloody conflict with the Borg, Dax had found herself the recipient of an unexpected field commission to Captain of the Aventine. On the wall opposite her desk, the painting hung their caught her eye. It was a replicated copy of Picasso’s famous painting ‘Les Demoiselles d'Avignon’. Five nude human women, contorted and abstracted, stared fiercely back at her.

The painting had belonged to Captain Dexar, the man who’d previously sat in the Aventine’s big chair. She thought of him often. His shadow loomed throughout the decks of the ship.

How many months had it been now? It could be ten, or twelve, or fourteen — had Dax lost count?

Dax’s stomach rumbled, and the pull of her body pushed the morose thoughts aside. She headed for the replicator. “Cottage pie and gravy, hot.”

The dish whirled into existence. She picked up the plate and set it on her desk.

Another dinner at the desk, a padd in one hand and a fork in the other. And those five women in that ugly Picasso staring at me the whole time.

Her desk mounted terminal chimed. Tapping the keyboard a couple of times, she pulled up the notification. It read: Holodeck time. 1200 hours. Klingon calisthenics program. One hour.

During these periods of relative quiet, holodecks came under heavy use from the crew. Every day, at midday, she headed to the holodeck for a round of Worf’s infamous “Klingon calisthenics program.” She never missed it. As a starship captain, she needed to maintain her fitness and her combat skills. One hour per day, she needed to feel the sweat pouring down her face, her heart pounding.

Dax needed to know she had what it took.

“Imposter syndrome, I know…” Dax said to the air. She had a habit of muttering her thoughts allowed. “Too much time eating alone, in this room.” She looked at the pile of padds lined up on her desk.

The responsible thing to do would be to sit down and finish those damned reports, one by one. Starfleet H.Q. didn’t like it when they were sent late. Dax picked up a padd and studied it for a moment. Then she looked at the door.

I need some excitement in my life.

After a quick change of clothes, she headed to the turbolift and down the holodeck 4. Her hand reached out for the panel but stopped short.

The holodeck was taken.

Although there were quite a few downsides to being the captain, one of the upsides is that people generally didn’t dare try and take your holodeck time from you. She’d come down here a hundred times at least, and every time the holodeck had been cleared on time.

“Computer, please tell me who is rude enough to be currently using holodeck 4? I have some demotions to give out.”

The ship’s computer answered, “Holodeck 4 is occupied by Commander Bowers, Lieutenant Leishman, Doctor Tarses, Lieutenant Commander Helkara, Lieutenant Kedair, Ensigns Hockney and Riordan…”

“Computer, stop reading out names,” she said. The computer silenced itself.

The entire senior staff are all on the holodeck… without me.

Dax felt her heart sinking into her stomach. Here she was, neck-deep in reports and Starfleet red-tape, looking for a single hour to herself — and the entire senior staff were on the holodeck, having fun. She checked the name of the program: Bowers_gettogether_1

Her hands formed in a fist. Dax took a deep breath and tried to release her tension. But, of course, no one wanted to hang out with the captain. ‘It’s lonely at the top’ — and all of that stuff.

With dragging feet, she started the long walk back to the turbolift.

From behind, she heard the dull hiss of doors opening. She turned and saw Commander Sam Bowers, her X.O. and friend — or so she thought — coming towards her.

“Captain,” he said, his eyes not quite meeting hers. “Aren’t you coming in for your regular fitness class? What is it again? Worf’s Killer Klingon Cage Fight or something?”

Dax forced a smile across her face. “I was, but when the sign says occupied, it’s usually best not to enter.”

“We were just finishing up,” Sam said. A smile moved across his dark-skinned, handsome face. “All this business with the Typhon Pact and being chased by the Romulan’s… Blowing off a little steam.”

Dax folded her arms. “Sam, how about this. You guys can extend your steam-blowing section for an extra hour. I’ve got a hundred reports due, all of them annoying.”

“Don’t be shy,” Sam said, “join us.”

“Listen, I know you’re trying to be the nice guy. And sometimes it’s not fun to have the captain at the cards table because suddenly no one wants to bet against her in case they win. I get it. It feels like the day before yesterday, I was nothing more than a ship’s counsellor, Lieutenant junior grade. Now I really do feel like the old-man Sisko would occasionally call me.”

Sam pinched his eyebrows together. “You lost me with that last part. But really, please join us. All it is a very informal, fun little thing on the holodeck. Come for five minutes.”

“I don’t want to be a third wheel. Or eighteenth wheel, judging by the number of people already in holodeck 4.”

“Come on, please? For me?”

Dax felt her shoulders hunch tight and then relax. So what was the point in arguing about it? “Sure,” she said.

“Great.”

Her X.O. marched alongside, half a grin on his face. What an odd facial expression he is pulling, Dax thought.

The doors to the holodeck slid open. A dozen or so people jumped in unison and yelled, “Surprise!”

In a split second, the breath caught in Dax’s throat. A huge white banner with bright red letters hung from the artificial ceiling. Happy Anniversary, Captain. Balloons dangled from the corner. Flanking one side of the room was a long table filled with champagne glasses and buckets filled with ice.

Dax placed her hand on her chest. “I think giving the captain a heart attack is a chargeable offence.”

Sam placed a gentle hand on her arm. “It’s been one year since you took command of this vessel. And Captain, I think I speak for everyone here when I say, it’s been an honour and a privilege.”

Lennoc Keddair walked over, a bottle of champagne in one hand and a fluted glass in the other. She poured Dax a drink and said, “Here is to four more years. And then four more years after that.”

“Cheers!” Everyone said in unison.

Clapping and laughter filled the room. Everyone came around to congratulate her. A whole year since that awful day, when her former captain and X.O. were killed in action. The Borg were everywhere. Death was everything.

To think something as beautiful as this could grow from terror and tragedy.

For a moment, she wondered if it were appropriate to be celebrating, consider how she came to captain the ship. But all those happy smiles on all those lovely faces… They need this just as much as I do. Perhaps more. We need to celebrate life, not just focus on death.

We need to live.

As Dax took a long sip of her champagne, the music kicked in.

***

Sometime later, two or three hours perhaps, Ezri made the wobbly walk back to her ready room. Sam had walked alongside her. He’d extended his hand before he left her and said congratulations one more time. It was a nice, firm handshake.

Presently, she collapsed into her chair and was, once again, alone. Nothing but a pile of padds and overdue reports for company. Luckily they’d only knocked back a few glasses of synthehol, so her mind was able to refocus.

Dax picked up a padd, and looked up. There they were. Picasso’s five nude women, writhed and transfigured, strange in her hollowness — like the artist had stripped away all their love and humanity. She could appreciate the art of old Earth’s famous Picasso, but that didn’t mean she had to like it.

She took down the painting with trembling hands and placed it behind the small blue couch that lined the viewscreen. Out of sight. She let out a long breath and said to the room, “Sorry, Captain Dexar, but I don’t much care for your taste in art.”
