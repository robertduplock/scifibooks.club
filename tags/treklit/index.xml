After the faintly disastrous Seize The Fire, I admit I felt some trepidation in picking up this novel. Luckily, Fallen Gods — while not a perfect novel — vastly improves on it&amp;rsquo;s predecessor.
T﻿he story centres has two main component — one involves an warring alien race, on a doomed planet, who once commanded advanced technology — while the other involves Riker caught in an ethical dilemma, as the Andorian members of his crew are due to be reassigned, due to Andoria succeeding from the Federation.</description></item><item><title>Interview with Una McCormack - Second Self</title><link>https://scifibooks.club/blog/interview-with-una-mccormack/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 06:31:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scifibooks.club/blog/interview-with-una-mccormack/</guid><description>U﻿na McCormack was kind enough to take some time out of her busy writing schedule to answer some questions regarding her new Star Trek: Picard novel, Second Self.
I understand that Second Self was originally scheduled for publication earlier in the year, but was delayed due to paper shortages. Has it been a tough time lately as a writer? Do you find these sorts of delays frustrating? I think it’s tough for everyone at the moment, really.</description></item></channel></rss>
