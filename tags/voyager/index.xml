And cut. Draw the curtains and clean the stage. &lt;em>Voyager&lt;/em> is home. Of course, all good Trek geeks turn to the books to continue the events once the show ends. Thus, Voyager&amp;rsquo;s relaunch is here, and veteran author Christie Golden is in charge.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Trek: Voyager: Full Circle book review</title><link>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-voyager-full-circle-book-review/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 23:15:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-voyager-full-circle-book-review/</guid><description>When Kirsten Beyer picked up the heavy gauntlet of the Voyager relaunch titles, she sure faced a challenge. Apart from tying up the loose ends from the preceding novels, she also had to: 1) Deal with &amp;ldquo;the Janeway thing&amp;rdquo; from Before Dishonor 2) Launch the Full Circle Fleet storyline 3) Work it all in with the aftermath of Star Trek: Destiny
Once more unto the Delta Quadrant, dear friends&amp;hellip;

Namely, putting the Voyager crew back into their original seats&amp;hellip; more or less. With &lt;em>Full Circle&lt;/em>, author Kirsten Beyer sent the U.S.S. Starship &lt;em>Voyager&lt;/em> hurtling back to the Delta Quadrant, thanks to some mean and lean slipstream technology. But the crew were still fractured, physically and emotionally — what will it take to bring Starfleet&amp;rsquo;s finest back to the adventure?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Trek: Voyager: Children of the Storm book review</title><link>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-voyager-children-storm-book-review/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 05:07:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-voyager-children-storm-book-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>Following up from two popular and successful Voyager novels, author Kirsten Beyer is back with her third post-&lt;em>Destiny&lt;/em> Voyager instalment. &lt;em>Children Of The Storm&lt;/em> takes place concurrently with the previous novel, &lt;em>Unworthy&lt;/em>.

No, that isn&amp;rsquo;t a spoiler — because she is on the front cover. The Eternal Tide continues Kirsten Beyer&amp;rsquo;s series of Voyager novels, which continue the story after the TV show&amp;rsquo;s finale.
Spoilers ahead
First things first, this is one helluva Star Trek book. Kirsten Beyer takes the extra time and puts in a little extra thought — perhaps even love — into each Voyager book she writes.</description></item><item><title>Star Trek: Voyager: Protectors by Kirsten Beyer book review</title><link>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-voyager-protectors-by-kirsten-beyer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 07:13:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/star-trek-voyager-protectors-by-kirsten-beyer/</guid><description>&lt;p>Kirsten Beyer is back with yet another &lt;em>Star Trek: Voyager&lt;/em> novel. &lt;em>Protectors&lt;/em> finds Admiral Janeway sent back to Earth for psych evaluations, while Chakotay and crew head out to re-investigate the spatial anomaly from the second season episode &lt;em>Twisted&lt;/em>, in which Voyager encountered an anomaly which twists and distorts the ship&amp;rsquo;s internal layout.&lt;/p>
