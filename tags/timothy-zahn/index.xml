&lt;p>Those two words compelled me to pick up a secondhand copy of &lt;em>Night Train to Rigel&lt;/em> by Timothy Zahn. At the time I&amp;rsquo;d just moved to Sydney with my wife â€” we were house hunting, I was searching for a co-working space and adjusting to a new life in a new city. I suppose, to help me deal with all the stress, I was looking for a fun read&amp;hellip; 300 pages of entertaining escapism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter the first entry in Mr Zahn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Quadrail&lt;/em> series.&lt;/p>

Zahn is the author of the &lt;em>Quadrail&lt;/em> books, the three &lt;em>Cobra&lt;/em> trilogies and more recently the &lt;em>Sybils War&lt;/em> trilogy. However, he is perhaps best known for his Star Wars tie-in novel series &lt;em>Heir To The Empire&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
