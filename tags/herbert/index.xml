After the lacklustre snoozefest that was God Emperor of Dune, I was hoping this book would lift the franchise near to its potential. And you know what? It kinda did.
Spoilers ahead!
First of all, Heretics of Dune does indeed suffer from some of the foibles common among the Dune sequels â€” it&amp;rsquo;s overly long, and over-written; often reaching for a kind of literary mastery that belies a very talented writer who is stuck writing crummy sci-fi and space opera.</description></item></channel></rss>
