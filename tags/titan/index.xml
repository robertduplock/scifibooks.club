So the king agreed to let the man experience what it was like to have power. When the man took a seat at the throne, the king arranged to have a sword dangling above the man&amp;rsquo;s head, held in place by a single thread. In this &lt;em>Titan&lt;/em> novel, the sword is &amp;ldquo;Erykon&amp;rsquo;s Eye&amp;rdquo;, and it dangles above an entire planet, threatening to unleash its awesome wrath. And &lt;em>Titan&lt;/em> is caught in the crossfire.&lt;/p>

Of course, he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know me from a bar of soap. But reading through the post-Nemesis Star Trek litverse, I&amp;rsquo;ve now read 14 books in the series. And I hate to say it, but Bennet is my least favourite Trek writer.
Over A Torrent Sea, published in 2009 and the fifth Titan spinoff, is the perfect example of why Bennet and I don&amp;rsquo;t gel.</description></item></channel></rss>
