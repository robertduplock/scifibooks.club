We read the classics, new releases and everything in between. We love everything from the pulpy B-grade space opera classics â€” to the newer, more literary outings.
When we&amp;rsquo;re not busy reviewing books, we like to read other reviews too! There are a lot of novels out there, many more than we could possibly review even if we lived as long as Leto II.</description></item></channel></rss>
