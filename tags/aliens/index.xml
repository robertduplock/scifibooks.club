Written by powerhouse duo Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle (with a bit of help from Steven Barnes), it tells the tale of a group of humans who endure a ten-year frozen trip out to a new planet to start a human colony.&lt;/p>

It fused the space opera of Star Trek, the world-building of Dune, and the militaristic elements of Starship Troopers. It&amp;rsquo;s 537 pages of space-faring goodness. And if you think Europe has a lot of museums, just wait until you get to Mote Prime.
Unlike Star Trek, Dune and Starship Troopers, The Mote In God&amp;rsquo;s Eye shows its age. Race still divides people.</description></item><item><title>Footfall book review</title><link>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/footfall-book-review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 02:42:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/footfall-book-review/</guid><description>Written in 1985, Footfall is an epic story of alien invasion. Niven &amp;amp; Pournelle write big books; the kind of books that would make an effective doorstop for even the heaviest of doors in the windiest of cities. Footfall, featuring dozens of characters and multiple, interweaving storylines, feels a lot like an epic movie. It&amp;rsquo;s hard not to compare it to the Roland Emerich school of storytelling; Indendepence Day in particular feels heavily influenced by Footfall.</description></item></channel></rss>
