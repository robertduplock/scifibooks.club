Martin returns to pen another Star Trek: Titan novel, Fallen Gods. The book is a direct sequel to his previous novel, Typhon Pact: Seize The Fire, and continues overall Typhon Pact arc.

After the faintly disastrous Seize The Fire, I admit I felt some trepidation in picking up this novel. Luckily, Fallen Gods — while not a perfect novel — vastly improves on it&amp;rsquo;s predecessor.
T﻿he story centres has two main component — one involves an warring alien race, on a doomed planet, who once commanded advanced technology — while the other involves Riker caught in an ethical dilemma, as the Andorian members of his crew are due to be reassigned, due to Andoria succeeding from the Federation.</description></item></channel></rss>
