&lt;p>Those two words compelled me to pick up a secondhand copy of &lt;em>Night Train to Rigel&lt;/em> by Timothy Zahn. At the time I&amp;rsquo;d just moved to Sydney with my wife — we were house hunting, I was searching for a co-working space and adjusting to a new life in a new city. I suppose, to help me deal with all the stress, I was looking for a fun read&amp;hellip; 300 pages of entertaining escapism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter the first entry in Mr Zahn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Quadrail&lt;/em> series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Spoilers ahead&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Foundation book review</title><link>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/foundation-book-review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 04:58:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/foundation-book-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>Books don’t get much bigger than Asimov’s &lt;em>Foundation&lt;/em>. Awarded “Best All-Time Series” in 1966, &lt;em>Foundation&lt;/em> was a trailblazer — some say it even invented the space opera genre. Needless to say, it’s difficult not to have high expectations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Spoilers ahead.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Mote In God's Eye book review</title><link>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/the-mote-in-god-s-eye-book-review/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 00:57:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/the-mote-in-god-s-eye-book-review/</guid><description>Published in 1974, The Mote In God’s Eye was a runaway success. It fused the space opera of Star Trek, the world building of Dune, and the militaristic elements of Starship Troopers. It’s 537 pages of space faring goodness. And if you think Europe has a lot of museums, just wait until you get to Mote Prime.
Unlike Star Trek, Dune and Starship Troopers, The Mote In God’s Eye shows its age.</description></item><item><title>Ghost Riders In The Sky by Timothy Zahn review</title><link>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/ghost-riders-in-the-sky-timothy-zahn-novella-book-review-c/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 11:05:21 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://scifibooks.club/reviews/ghost-riders-in-the-sky-timothy-zahn-novella-book-review-c/</guid><description>&lt;p>In 2020, veteran sci-fi author Timothy Zahn dipped his toe into self-publishing for the first time, releasing the original novella &lt;em>Ghost Riders in The Sky&lt;/em>. Zahn is the author of the &lt;em>Quadrail&lt;/em> books, the three &lt;em>Cobra&lt;/em> trilogies and more recently the &lt;em>Sybils War&lt;/em> trilogy. However, he is perhaps best known for his Star Wars tie-in novel series &lt;em>Heir To The Empire&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
